            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Two things are conſiderable in the words.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. The perſon, <hi>Apollos:</hi> of whom I intended to have ſpoken little, or nothing, but that I obſerve the <hi>Church-Levellers</hi> of our time, who would remove the ancient land-marks, pull up the hedges, and lay the miniſterial office open, and in common to all, whoſe confidence, covetouſneſs, or ambition makes them pretend to Gifts; or whom the leſs judicious multitude out of faction, or ſeparation, or envy to the ſetled miniſtery, or affectation of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or weakneſs and raſhneſs ſhall judge <hi>gifted,</hi> though not <hi>called</hi> or <hi>ordained:</hi> they make this inſtance of <hi>Apollos,</hi> as one of their <hi>aſylums</hi> to flee to, whom they alleadge as a <hi>gifted</hi> brother, no <hi>ordained</hi> preacher. Give me leave therefore to ſuggeſt briefly ſome few hints to you, which may lead us into a more full diſcovery of the perſon, and may drive theſe pretenders from that refuge, which they have betaken themſelves to in this inſtance of <hi>Apollos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is probable that <hi>Apollos</hi> (being an <hi>Alexandrian</hi>) was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the ſchool of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> who firſt planted the Chriſtian faith here, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhews; or, as others conjecture, among the<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Eſſens,</hi> who had a famous ſchool at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and, if you believe <hi>Baronius,</hi> were convert Jews turned Chriſtians; which he thinks probable, both becauſe thoſe hiſtorians which ſpeak of the Jews, as <hi>Joſephus, Strabo,</hi> and the reſt, are wholly ſilent concerning this ſect; and chiefly becauſe all the ſects of the Jews, as <hi>Phariſees, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces; Herodians,</hi> the ſcripture ſpeaks of as enemies to Chriſt, but we read of no oppoſition Chriſt met with from the <hi>Eſſens,</hi> nor doth Chriſt ever charge or denounce woes againſt them, as againſt the reſt: though I know others impute this to the fewneſs of that ſect in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whileſt our Saviour lived, or elſe to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quietneſs, and calm of their ſpirit, not being given to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, (as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, men of more hot and fiery ſpirits) it being part of their religion, as it is of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our times, to ſuffer every man in his; certain it is and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of all, that they were very diligent, and induſtrious in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcriptures of the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> eſpecially the Prophets, and ſo might learn much of Chriſt; and here, it is likely, <hi>Apollos</hi> might get his large ſcripture-knowledge, which he ſo powerfully mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57001:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the conviction of the Jews concerning Chriſt; for verſe 28. it is ſaid, that <hi>He mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, ſhewing by the ſcriptures, that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Obſerve the <hi>place,</hi> where <hi>Apollos</hi> preached; it was not a Chriſtian conſtituted Church, but a Jewiſh Synagogue, <hi>verſe 26. He began to ſpeak boldly in the Synagogue.</hi> It was a generall, though corrupt, cuſtome amongſt the Jews to indulge libertie to learned men, though no prieſts, to teach in their Synagogues; as the Scribes and the Lawyers, which the Goſpel every where ſpeaks of: upon which cuſtome it was that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> was ſo oft permitted to preach in their Synagogues, as we read throughout this book of the <hi>Acts:</hi> hence the teaching of the Scribes is oppoſed to that authority wherewith Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29. it is ſaid, Chriſt taught the people <hi>as one having authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> who had none: So we finde <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> here preaching in the Synagogue, <hi>non ut habens autoritatem, ſed ſcientiam,</hi> ſaith the learned <hi>Eſtius,</hi> as making uſe of, and taking<note place="margin">
                        <hi>in locum, &amp;</hi> Mat. 4. v. ult.</note> advantage of that indulgence of the Jews to preach and ſpread the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Obſerve the <hi>time</hi> when he preached; it was when God for the more ſpeedy and effectuall propagating of the Goſpel poured out plentifully of the extraordinary Gifts of his Spirit, and it would be raſhneſs in any one to aſſert, that <hi>Apollos</hi> was not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily Gifted: and if ſo, this inſtance will nothing at all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thoſe pretenders who want ordinary Gifts.</p>
                  <p>4. Conſider that this <hi>Apollos</hi> was one of <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples; <hi>ver.</hi> 25. it is ſaid, <hi>He knew only the baptiſme of John,</hi> that is to ſay, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>John</hi> concerning Chriſt to come; and it may probably be thought the contrary cannot be proved, that he was authorized and commiſſionated by <hi>John</hi> to preach the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>5. Obſerve what this <hi>Apollos</hi> was afterwards; an eminent, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and authorized preacher in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> S. <hi>Pauls</hi> helper and ſucceſſor 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 6. I have planted</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) and Apollo watered,</hi> and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him <hi>his brother, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 12. and he is, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in expreſs terms called, <hi>a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, 1 Cor. 3. 5. Who is</hi> Paul? <hi>or who is</hi> Apollos? <hi>but miniſters by whom ye believed;</hi> and ſo famous he was, that he hath the churches approbation of his Gifts, <hi>verſe</hi> 27. and when he came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he was ſo eminent, that he proved the head of a ſect and faction (which is the higheſt ambition of their pretenders) 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. One ſaith I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Chriſt;</hi> and though this was after his preaching here at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yet I (reading of no ordination he received afterwards) have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57001:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> good reaſon to believe that he was now ordained.</p>
                  <p>6. Negative teſtimonies from Scripture in things circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall are but illogicall, and inartificiall arguments. God indeed hath in things fundamentall to faith and holineſs made a plentifull proviſion in ſcripture, which is able to <hi>make a man wiſe to ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 17.</note> and <hi>perfect to every goodwork.</hi> To aſſume any thing as a rule of life; or foundation of faith, more then that the ſcripture affords, is to impoſe upon our ſelves, and defame the ſcriptures; but ſilence of ſcripture in things circumſtantiall, eſpecially in particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is not rationally argumentative. <hi>Argumentum ab autoritate negante, ſed non ab autoritate negativè, valet in Theologicis,</hi> ſaith a reverend man of our own: if ſcripture had ſaid plainly, that <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> was not ordained, the inſtance had been of ſome force, but to argue, he was not ordained becauſed the ſcripture doth not ſay, <hi>toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem verbis,</hi> he was ſo, is to me a very irrationall and unſatisfactory argument. Nay, if we conſider the peremptory ſtrictneſs of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-commands, none ſhould take this office upon him, but he that is called as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and that was done by the outward appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and withall conſidering the Apoſtles care to leave <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain in every citie, and his ſtrict charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> to wit, without examination of his<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 22.</note> Gifts and abilities, and all this to prevent diſorderly, promiſcuous, daring intruſion into the miniſteriall office; conſidering withall the ſolemn ſeparating of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> by prayer and laying<note place="margin">Acts 13. 12.</note> on of hands, which calling and appointment S. <hi>Paul</hi> frequently aſſerts to uphold his authority amongſt them to whom he wrote, as to the <hi>Romans</hi> he tels them he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>unto the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> laying theſe things and many more which might be alleadged together, we, I think, finding <hi>Apollos</hi> here preaching (which may equally ſatisfie other inſtances brought out of ſcripture,) have good ground to believe he was ordained, though the ſcripture be ſilent in it, when it doth not aſſert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>7. If all this will not ſatisfie the objectors, let me adde this laſt by way of conceſſion; let thoſe, who lay this inſtance as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a <hi>Babel</hi> of confuſion in the church (for there can be no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a rude and promiſcuous parity) I ſay, let thoſe pretenders demonſtrate themſelves to be <hi>Apollo's,</hi> men <hi>eloquent, and mighty in the ſcriptures,</hi> and for my part (though I think thoſe moſt fit to ſit in <hi>Pauls</hi> chair, who have been educated, and inſtructed at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>) I profeſs, I ſee no great reaſon, or evidence of ſcripture, why they may not be admitted to the miniſteriall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But when either out of weakneſs they dare not, or out of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57001:17"/> pride and faction they will not ſubmit themſelves to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and appointment of thoſe whom ſcripture, precept, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical practiſe, and uninterrupted cuſtom of the church hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred to ſet apart and authoriſe men for this office, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the right door; but will audaciouſly climbe up ſome other way (excuſe the expreſſion from uncharitableneſs, 'tis our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours concerning the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were like intruders in theſe daies) they are but thieves and robbers, ſtealing away the hearts and affection of the people, yea, and the maintenance too from the right and duly-conſtituted miniſtrie.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations of the perſon I humbly and willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your judgements, and ſhall come now to thoſe qualifications, which were the intended ſubject of my diſcourſe, when I firſt laid out my thoughts upon theſe words.</p>

                  <p>The candle of the Lord, as the ſoul of man is called, may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſomething (though but darkly) of God, but Scripture onely is the ſtar to lead us unto Chriſt.

                  <p>2. The excellencie of the revelation it ſelf, or manner of revealing them, which appears upon a three-fold account.</p>
                  <p>1. The fulneſs and ſufficiencie of it, both as to doctrine and practice, faith and maners, both to make a man of God <hi>wiſe unto</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. Scripture contains a full revelation of all foundations of faith, or things neceſſarie to be believed to ſalvation, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or by convincing, evident, and undeniable conſequence, and needs not to be eeked out with unwritten traditions, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enthuſiaſmes and revelations. Tradition, which brings down and conveys Scripture-truths through the ſucceſſive ages of the Church to us, we cannot without ingratitude but acknowledge as an eminent inſtance, and teſtimonie of Gods providence, and none of the leaſt arguments for the authoritie, and Divinitie of Scripture; and in this ſence the Church is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar holds forth the Kings proclamation, but contributes no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to it. And in this ſence too, S. <hi>Augustin's non credidiſsem Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturae niſi Eccleſiae autoritas commoveret,</hi> may go for good and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Divinitie: we could not have believed the Scripture, becauſe we could not have had it, if providence had not handed it to us by the Church. So revelation of Scripture-myſteries by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God we acknowledge as the accompliſhment of a great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-promiſe of the Spirit <hi>leading us into all truth:</hi> which therefore<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 13.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> praies for for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that God would give unto them <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>think to have eternall life:</hi> and our Saviour doth not blame them for thinking ſo.

                  <p>The Scripture was made to be a Chriſtians guide, and rule of life (as I ſaid before): a blinde guide, a dark and obſcure rule is a contradiction. <hi>Thy word is a light to my feet, and a lanthorn to my</hi>

                  <p>This was one end of Scripture, That we might have an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule of life, and judge of ſaving truth; which, had it been brought unto us onely by the acry conveyance of Tradition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain revelation, might ſoon have been either forgotten, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.

                  <p>A man can ſcarce ever know when he hath believed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rightly, or enough: Traditions being variable, and oft in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſucceſſions, one contrarie to another, in the guidances, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Paſtors and Teachers.

The chief cauſe of the light Scepticiſme, and wavering unſettledneſs of our times, is the want of a ſound Scripture-knowledge of the Truth, with which if mens ſpirits were well ballaſſed, they would not ſo ſoon be <hi>toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about</hi> and <hi>carried away with every wind of doctrine.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſpeaking of ſuch, gives this account of it: that <hi>they were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

Here we <hi>may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſeth it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 11. The promiſe is as full of comfort as a dugge is full of milk; as crying children are quietted with the dugge, ſo perplexed conſciences are quieted and eaſed by the promiſes; this all other knowledge in the world cannot help you too. What refuges hath <hi>Seneca,</hi> the wiſeſt of <hi>Stoicks,</hi> found for doubting and troubled mindes? and yet all end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mere diſquietneſs. Not <hi>Athens</hi> muſt teach this leſſon, but <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> not Reaſon, but Revelation; not Nature, but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. I have read of a woman, who was much diſquieted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, even to deſpair, and endeavouring to prove her own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, was comforted by that promiſe, <hi>Iſaiah 57. 15.

                  <p>3. It is a <hi>Transforming</hi> knowledge; which no other knowledge is.

                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> the Goſpel offers him, and conveys him, our faith receives him, our love imbraces him, our hope expects him, our obedience imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and honours him; the promiſes are grounded upon him, by the Goſpel-priviledges purchaſed by him. Thus Chriſt is the Center, wherein all theſe lines of revealed truth meet, and when a Miniſter hath diſcovered Chriſt, he hath done all; and this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without the Scriptures, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5. 3.

                  <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> (in this an enemy of <hi>mans nature</hi> as in the whole model of his doctrine he is of <hi>Gods grace</hi>) denies all natural, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innate or acquired, knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> advanceth the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> too high, while he aſſerts the improvements of it to be ſufficient to reach a <hi>ſaving</hi> diſcovery of God: either <hi>immediately,</hi> or (as thoſe who ſpeak with the greateſt modeſty aſſert) <hi>mediatly</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitively (ut diſponan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur homines ad praedicationem Evangelii,</hi> as the <hi>Dort-Remonſtrants</hi> determine) as obliging God to the beſtowing and diſpoſing men to the receiving farther and <hi>ſaving</hi> diſcoveries from God. Each of theſe doctrines is ſuited, and fitted to comply with that <hi>model</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which theſe <hi>Doctors</hi> have broached and vented to the world.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> muſt not acknowledge man at firſt to have been created <hi>after the image of God in righteouſneſs and knowledge,</hi> (which <hi>Smalcius</hi> therefore calls <hi>Idaea quaedam in cerebro nata</hi>) leſt he be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated<note place="margin">

Now, as conſiſtent to all this, it is his intereſt to deny all natural knowledge of God, which we truly aſſert to be the reliques and remains of that Divine image, which God drew upon mans ſoul in his firſt creation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> in order to uphold the Doctrine of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Redemption,</hi> muſt of neceſſitie aſſert an univerſal ſufficiencie of means allowed to <hi>all,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>thoſe</hi> who never heard of the Goſpel; which their Engliſh Advocate knew well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore roundly aſſerts, that <hi>men may by the light of nature gather <gap reason="foreign">

Not that the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries all uſe of Philoſophy (as ſome in our daies, it is hard to ſay whether with more ignorance or impudence, do) but only ſo far as it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ſurely all is not ſuch, unleſs it be in vain to be rational, that is to ſay, to be men; for Philoſophy is nothing but the genuine birth of right reaſon: and <hi>res Dei ratio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> (the <hi>candle of the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) who yet decries Philoſophers, as <hi>Haereſiarcharum Patriarchas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> ſo far as corrupted; but the errours of Philoſophy do no more argue the uſeleſsneſs of Philoſophy, then the errours of Divines evacuate the ſtudie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie. Theſe belong to Philoſophy no otherwiſe then wens or boyls to the bodie, which being cut off, or cured, the bodie remains uſeful and neceſſarie. Philoſophy is not oppoſite, but aſſiſtant to Divinitie (and while <hi>Hagar</hi> will wait upon <hi>Sarah,</hi> no reaſon why ſhe ſhould be thrown out of doors) though Philoſophers have oft been the greateſt enemies, and oppoſers of it. To ſumme up all, if thoſe who had onely the light of nature be thus in the dark, if neither Chriſt, nor the means of ſalvation, nor the true worſhip of God were diſcoverable by it, it's ſufficiencie to any ſaving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, may, I hope, from the premiſes be rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> have one ſalve for all this, which is that the (<hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt</hi>) improvements of the light of nature, though they be not immediatly ſufficient to ſalvation, yet do diſpoſe to the receptions of farther communications of grace, and ſaving diſcoveries of God: ſo the <hi>Dort-Remonſtrants</hi> determine. Truth<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 327.</note> is, they have ſo many ſubterfuges in making out a ſufficiencie of means to thoſe who had onely the light of nature, that we may ſay of them, what the Hiſtorian obſerves of ſome of the enemies of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57001:42"/> the <hi>Romanes, Major aliquantò labor eſt invenire quàm vincere.</hi> Give me leave a little to trace thoſe footſteps I obſerve they have left behinde them in their writings, as to that univerſally pleaded, <hi>facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti quod in ſe eſt.</hi> I ſay,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who ever improved natural light and abilities to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt? If the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> pleaſe (though I think it will not quit charges) to ſend out a <hi>hue</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> after ſuch, I am confident the return will be a <hi>non eſt inventus,</hi> nor could they, though oft ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to it, bring one inſtance of any who have by natural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments arrived at faith: could any have been produced, we ſhould have heard of it with both ears long before this time. <hi>Arminius</hi> ſure was ſenſible of this, That none ever improved nature to the height, therefore in his writings againſt <hi>Perkins</hi> flees to a <hi>minùs malè,</hi> thoſe who improve <hi>ſomewhat better</hi> a natural light then others. But then I demand,</p>
                  <p>1. What degree of improvement ſhall diſpoſe for farther grace? and,</p>
                  <p>2. Whether all, except ſome few of the moſt profligate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, be not upon this account diſpoſed for ſaving grace? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we ſtand to the verdict of the <hi>Dort-Remonſtrants,</hi> who determine all to be diſpoſed, <hi>qui omnem rationis uſum non excuſſerunt,</hi> and then few, if any, are excluded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How this aſſertion differs from the <hi>Popiſh</hi> merit <hi>ex congruo,</hi> I ſhall leave it to you to judge, and to them to make out. I am ſure both are equally contradictorie to the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Who hath called us not according to works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and grace:</hi> but if upon improvements of nature, it certainly is of works.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doth not this Doctrine friendly ſhake hands with old <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> in making grace and nature of the ſame latitude and extent? <hi>Mutant vocem propter horrorem hominis Haeretici evitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ut ſic eandem pravitatis ſententiam Sophiſtici palliatam introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: sicque corda ſimplicium faciliùs corrumpunt,</hi> they are the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi> in this very particular: they<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God is no way obliged to make farther diſcoveries of himſelf upon the improvements of nature:</p>
                  <p>1. The improvements themſelves cannot oblige God, as being not acceptable to him, the higheſt moralities of the Heathens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57001:43"/> but <hi>corrupt fruit</hi> of a <hi>corrupt tree,</hi> Matt. 7. 18. and being not the actions of <hi>perſons in Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>iſſuing from faith, without which it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. cannot bring any obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</p>
                  <p>2. God hath not engaged himſelf by promiſe, to make ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of <hi>grace</hi> upon the improvements of nature: for</p>
                  <p>1. Then God ſhould oft be falſe to his promiſe, it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he hath oft beſtowed his Goſpel and grace upon thoſe, who have leaſt improved their naturals, as upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

Miniſterial gifts are like the <hi>widows oyle,</hi> which <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by being poured out;</hi> whereas <hi>wrapping theſe talents in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,</hi> by a careleſs negligence or remiſsneſs, endangers the loſs both of our <hi>talents,</hi> and of our <hi>ſouls, Take from him the talent,</hi> verſ. 28. <hi>Cast the unprofitable ſervant into uttter darkneſs,</hi> verſ. 30. but here is not the leaſt aſſurance, or promiſe given of <hi>grace</hi> upon the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>nature.</hi> The improvement was in the ſame kinde, and ſo the good uſe of <hi>naturals</hi> may be recompenſed with a ſuperaddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of greater natural abilities: as God crowns the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>grace</hi> with farther degrees of <hi>grace.</hi> Beſides the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reſult of the good improvements of theſe <hi>talents,</hi> was <hi>glorie, Enter into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> which the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> themſelves will<note place="margin">Verſe 23.</note> not have to be the reward of a good uſe of <hi>nature,</hi> but onely a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſaving grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God therefore is free from all obligation, either by <hi>mans merit,</hi> or his <hi>own promiſe.</hi> Yea, but God will do it, <hi>ſine alique obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, ex meraliberalitate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Corvinus</hi> oft in ſeveral places of his writings againſt <hi>Moulin;</hi> but we may juſtly wonder how <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> came to be of Gods ſecret councel, that he can determine what God will do, where there is no promiſe declaring that will; or what aſſurance can be given to any of <hi>grace</hi> upon the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>nature?</hi> where there is no promiſe to engage God, or found any well-grounded expectation. And what leſs then the height of impudence is it for the creature to fix laws to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57001:43"/> and preſcribe methods to God, which he hath not fixed in his word; but this method is laid <hi>ipſâ aequitate Dei naturali,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus, upon the equitie of Gods nature,</hi> which obligeth him to it. But is it not as raſh pride and preſumption, to determine of Gods juſtice, otherwiſe then God hath done in Scripture? on, but God ſaith, <hi>What could I have done more for my vineyard?</hi> Eſay 5. 4. but what? becauſe God gives a ſufficiencie of outward means to his Church, ſhall his equitie therefore oblige him to give ſufficiencie of <hi>inward grace,</hi> to thoſe who are without the Church? I leave you to judge of this <hi>Logick,</hi> and ſhall conlude this point with that excellent determination of <hi>Alvarez, Nulla lex fuit unquam ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta de dandis auxiliis gratiae facientibus totum quod in ſe eſt ex faculta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te naturae, neque Chriſtus morte ſuâ meruit, aut merere voluit talem legem: God never made, and Chriſt never did, or would merit ſuch a law, which ſhould oblige God to the conferring of grace upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Are not the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> in this Doctrine direct <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi> to Scripture? which every where reſolves all ſaving diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and communications from God, into his diſcriminating will, not mans <hi>previous</hi> improvements. <hi>Cur his conferat, praeteritis aliis,</hi>

But (<hi>Brethren</hi>) this is a <hi>Chymaera,</hi> and a dream, which the Scripture gives us no ground to believe: nay, that tells you that God ſuffered
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57001:44"/> thoſe who had onely the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> the Gentiles, <hi>to walk in their own ways,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>extra ſuam gratiam degere,</hi> if <hi>Proſpers</hi>

Sed quorſum haec perditio?</hi> may ſome ſay, <hi>To what purpoſe is all this waste of time and words?</hi> I ſhall hope to evidence it no labour in vain, by diſcovering the practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this truth in the <hi>Application,</hi> which I ſhall with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible brevitie diſpatch.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, This may help us to diſcover the ſandy foundation on which the Doctrine of <hi>univerſal redemption,</hi> and conſequently the whole fabricke of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> ſtands. For, if this piller be pulled down, the whole building falls about their ears, which makes them ſo induſtriouſly voluminous in aſſerting this doctrine above all the reſt. Or if the purchaſe be particular, then the purpoſe of God, the execution of which that purchaſe makes way for, muſt be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; the neceſſary conſequents of which muſt be the certain effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>perſeverance of Saints,</hi> becauſe Gods purpoſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fruſtrated. Now this Doctrine of <hi>univerſal redemption</hi> cannot be upheld without the deſignation of ſufficient meanes afforded to all men, which to thoſe who never heard of the Goſpel can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the improvements of nature: God not affording, nay (that I may prevent that common cavill <hi>Deus paratus eſt</hi>) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to afford, the Goſpel to many of them. <hi>Paul</hi> was expreſly<note place="margin">Acts 16. 6.</note> forbidden by the holy Ghoſt to preach the word in <hi>Aſia:</hi> and the Apoſtles at firſt commanded not to goe into the way of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.<note place="margin">Matt. 10. 5.</note> Well but though they had not the Goſpel, yet <hi>non defuerunt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia quaedam communiora,</hi> ſaith <hi>Corvinus:</hi> but what other thoſe ſhould be beſides the light and improvements of nature is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, the inſufficiency of which to ſalvation hath, I hope, been in ſome meaſure evinced by the former part of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence be perſwaded to ſet your ſelves in oppoſition to this doctrine, in doing which you appear for the honour of Gods grace and Goſpel. <hi>Bradwardine</hi> juſtly entitled his book <hi>de cauſa Dei,</hi> when he wrote againſt the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> whoever peruſeth it ſeriouſly will finde it a moſt ſoveraigne Antidote againſt the poyſon of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme,</hi> againſt which in this point it is Gods and your intereſt to appear.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57001:44"/> Firſt, As you are <hi>miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> The Doctrine of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the light of <hi>nature</hi> vilifies and debaſeth your office: for what need the Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Apoſtles and their Succeſſours <hi>to teach all nations,</hi> if God had before commiſſionated<note place="margin">Matth: 28. 19.</note> and improwered Sun, Moon, and Stars to do it? or what need the Stars in the <hi>right hand</hi> of Chriſt, if thoſe in the <hi>firmament</hi> have light enough to lead us to him? Nay doth not this argue you the greateſt impoſtours, while you impoſe <hi>hearing, reading, prayer, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, meditation, grapling with the difficulties of Scripture</hi> upon the people in order to the knowledge of God and Chriſt: which an <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>American</hi> can arrive at by the contemplation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and providences of God?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As you are <hi>Scholars.</hi> This Doctrine, I apprehend, makes <hi>Univerſities</hi> and <hi>Commencements</hi> uſeleſs: no need ſure of the <hi>Schools of the Prophets;</hi> you may go without any expences to ſchool to the creatures. What need youth hazard their eyes in ſtudying the <hi>apices</hi> and <hi>points</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, for the underſtanding of the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> (in the latter of which ſome of natures Advocates tell us, there is not a word to be found of faith in Chriſt) which the Gentiles can arrive at by the improvement of Nature, and read written in the legible characters of the heavenly bodies?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As you are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> eſpecially: for this Doctrine,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Robs you of your priviledges in the enjoyment of the Goſpel and means of grace.</hi> Surely, the Apoſtle was out when he put a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note> to this as the <hi>greatest</hi> priviledge of the Jews, that <hi>to them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God:</hi> and our Saviour miſtook, when he ſaid, <hi>Salvation was of the Jews.</hi> Why it ſeems by this Doctrine the<note place="margin">Joh. 4. 22.</note> Gentiles were every whit as near it, whom yet the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to be <hi>without hope.</hi> And ſurely we Chriſtians do but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> our ſelves in a <hi>fools-paradiſe,</hi> while we imagine our ſelves ſo highly advanced in our priviledges above the <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>American,</hi> who by this Doctrine can oblige God to give them that grace, which we profeſs no claim to after our utmoſt improvements of the Goſpel; but ſay as our Saviour hath taught us, <hi>We are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 17. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>ſervants.</hi> What great priviledge is it to enjoy Ordinances, if the creatures, and providences of God, can bring any to a <hi>ſaving</hi> diſcovery of him? Or what great advantage to be planted within the <hi>pale</hi> of the Church, the <hi>incloſed garden</hi> of God, if the dew of grace fall as plentifully upon the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> of the world? Or what need their being <hi>added unto the Church who ſhould be ſaved, if they</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. 47.</note> might as well have attained it out of the Church? Certainly (<hi>Brethren</hi>) God cannot but be highly provoked by ſuch underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing theſe high Goſpel-priviledges.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57001:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>2. <hi>It voids the exerciſe of Chriſtian duties; it deſtroys a Chriſtians gratitude and thankfulneſs.</hi> It is in event to tell God that he was at an unneceſſary expence, when he gave us the Goſpel; and it muſt needs dull and take off the edge of our devotions for the Heathen, and quench all zeal, and cut the ſinews of all endeavours for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over to the embracing of the Goſpel; and tells us we are guilty of a fooliſh ignorant commiſeration when we pity them. Nay, they might rather (were this Doctrine true) pity us, who go about a circuit for that knowledge, which they have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way to.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Then no reaſon ſo highly to admire (as ſome do) the <hi>moralities</hi> and <hi>improvements</hi> of the Heathens, which as <hi>glow-worms</hi> might have ſome <hi>glimmering</hi> luſtre in the night of <hi>ignorance;</hi> but now the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>ariſen,</hi> they appear to be but of an <hi>earthly</hi> extraction. <hi>Put antur eſſe virtutes, in quibus regnat ſuperbia &amp; quaedam ſibi placendi altitudo ruinoſa,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> A <hi>vein</hi> of<note place="margin">

Let us commiſerate and pray for thoſe who ſit in darkneſs, let us in <hi>Goſhen</hi> pity <hi>Egypt:</hi> but let's not advance <hi>nature</hi> in them to the diſparagement of the <hi>grace</hi> and Goſpel of God amongſt our ſelves: leſt while we would ſeem <hi>charitable,</hi> we prove <hi>unthankfull,</hi> and by magnifying the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> we diſparage the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and rob God of his freeneſs, and ſpecialty of his grace. Holy <hi>Bernard,</hi> complaining to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> of <hi>Abelardus</hi> (Profeſſour at <hi>Paris,</hi> who it ſeems amongſt many other errours, had broached this, which I have been diſcourſing of,) cenſures him thus, <hi>Dum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm ſudat quomodo Platonem faciat Chriſtianum, ſe probat Ethaicum; While he would make Plato a Chriſtian, he proves himſelf a Heathen.</hi> And certainly thoſe, who ſo highly advance <hi>natural light,</hi> can have but low, mean, and very undervaluing thoughts of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Improve Goſpel-diſcoveries of God,</hi> by walking anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to ſuch revelation, let your converſations be ſuch as become<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note> the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.

                     <hi>when they knew God, glorified him not as God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith it did; how much more inexcuſable ſhall the abuſe of Goſpel-light, and <hi>impriſoning</hi> it by ſin, leave Chriſtians? <hi>Solons, Socrates, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pioes, Catoes</hi> will appear in judgment againſt many pretended Chriſtians: <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon.</hi> When God<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 15 Rom. 2. 9.</note> comes to adminiſter juſtice upon the ungodly: it will be <gap reason="foreign">

Darkneſs ſeems never ſo diſmall as to thoſe, who go immediately from the light: the darkneſs of hel will be ſadder to none, then to thoſe, who fall into it from under the light of the Goſpel. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans plea of ignorance will not excuſe him, becauſe voluntarily contracted, and wilfully lived in; but a Chriſtians improved know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will much more condemn him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Then let's not pride our ſelves in our natural improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in our parts and endowments.</hi> We are here in a place of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and let us improve to the height (for queſtionleſs we muſt be accountable to God for our <hi>talents</hi> of <hi>natural abilities, depth</hi> of <hi>judgment, acuteneſs</hi> of <hi>wit, ſtrength</hi> of <hi>memory, quickneſs</hi> of <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> which I wiſh they did really believe, or ſeriouſly conſider, who abuſe theſe to the reproach of Religion, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truths of God): but let's not reſt in theſe, as in themſelves ſetting us a whit the nearer to the <hi>ſaving grace</hi> of God.

                     </gap>. A Merchant when he comes to a mart or fair, he takes his firſt ſeaſon and opportunity of purchaſing his commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, puts it not off to the hazard of an evening, or the next dayes bargain, upon preſumption then to have it cheaper, leſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities be gone in the mean ſeaſon. In this, <hi>the children of this world are wiſer in their generations,</hi> then we who pretend to be <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light.</hi> How do moſt neglect the preſent time God puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands? play, idle, nay, ſin away their market-day, upon that preſumption to have grace and glory at a very cheap and eaſie rate, when they come to die? reſolve, perhaps, ſometime hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to trade for ſuch merchandiſe which are ſpiritual, and while they are reckoning, the evening of death overtakes them, and the mart breaks up, and ſo they are miſerably diſappointed.

                  <p>Thirdly, An act of <hi>diſcretion</hi> in <hi>laying out</hi> our <hi>time</hi> in our <hi>proper callings,</hi> as oppoſed to thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. It is poſſible for a man to ſtudy hard, and take a great deal of pains to looſe his time, and to be laboriouſly idle, when he layes not out his time in reference to that particular calling he is deſigned for. A Merchant we know regards not the traffick of other men, but layes out his time and skill for that merchandize which belongs to his particular trade: ſo ſhould we in the improvement of our time, look eſpecially to that concernment of our particular callings. A man may miſpend his time as much <hi>aliud agendo,</hi> as <hi>nihil agendo,</hi> doing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57001:53"/> that which <hi>nothing concerns him,</hi> as by <hi>doing nothing at all.</hi> Such are thoſe <hi>Dictatores ab aratro,</hi> who leap from the <hi>plough</hi> or <hi>ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board</hi> into the <hi>pulpit:</hi> they may ſeem to be <hi>zealous redeemers</hi> of their <hi>time;</hi> but indeed miſpend it as unhappily in placing their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon that, which God never deſigned them unto: therefore the Apoſtle oft reſtrains our diligence to our particular callings. Rom. 12. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether propheſie, let us propheſie according to the proportion of faith: or miniſtery; let us wait on our miniſtring, or he that teacheth on teaching: or he that exhorteth on exhortation, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo we may ſee how ſpecially he inſtructs <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 13. <hi>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine:</hi> and verſ. 15. <hi>meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them:</hi> fit employment indeed for a <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſuitable to the ſpecial office of the miniſtery. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20. he layes down a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for all: <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling, wherein he is called,</hi> and in that improve, and redeem his time. <hi>Domitian</hi> was very induſtrious, but in that unbeſeemed his eſtate &amp; employment: viz. in <hi>catching flies. Nero</hi> loſt his time, when he ſtudied and affected more the commendation of a <hi>skilfull fidler</hi> then a <hi>good Emperour.</hi> Our imployments ſhould bee fitted to our callings, and if ſo, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the meaneſt calling is acceptable ſervice unto God: but if otherwiſe, the greateſt labour is but loſt time. Thus for a Miniſter to be immerſed in worldly employments is miſpence of his time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as to his main end and deſign of his office. Chriſt will endure no <hi>buyers</hi> and <hi>ſellers</hi> in the <hi>Temple.</hi> That diligence, which is commendable in one, may be loſs of time in another: thus <hi>Romances, plays,</hi> and ſuch like are miſpence of time in one, whoſe deſign is the handling of the <hi>ſacred oracles?</hi> the <hi>plea</hi> for them is that they <hi>elevate</hi> the <hi>phanſy,</hi> the truth is, rather they <hi>effeminate</hi> the <hi>minde,</hi> that ſhould in the mean time be exerciſed in deepeſt ſpeculations.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, An act of <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>ſollicitude</hi> in regaining time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly miſpent: that is, by doubling their diligence for the future. Time let ſlip is <hi>Phyſically</hi> irrecoverable, but in a <hi>moral</hi> conſideration is accounted as regained, when we double our endeavours and care. As a Merchant, who hath had great loſs, doubles his labour in his future traffique: ſo ſhould we who have miſpent our time (and which of us hath not too much?) now redeem it, by a more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and conſcientious improvement of it. Thus we may at once teſtifie the ſincerity of our ſorrow for our former miſpence, and in ſome meaſure repair the diſhonour we have thereby done to God. Thus S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had wickedly laid out his time in blaſpheming and perſecuting the Church, afterward redeemed it, by <hi>labouring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57001:53"/> more abundantly</hi> then all the reſt of the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It ſpeaks an act of <hi>prudence,</hi> in chooſing and embracing the fitteſt opportunities and ſeaſons for all our actions, and this is the proper import of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>. A Merchant watcheth the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt opportunity for his trade and purchaſe: ſo ſhould Chriſtians chooſe the fitteſt ſeaſon for all their actions, wherein they moſt promote Gods glory, their own and others good. All acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion are not ſeaſonable at all times: the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon,</hi> Ecleſ. 3. 1. as to inſtance. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal correption,</hi> a duty, in which, if duly exerciſed, the good of Chriſtians is much concerned, yet not ſeaſonable at many times; as to reproove a ſcorner in the height of his ſcorning; or a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard in the heat of his cups. When the poor begs, there is thy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of charity, or when their cauſe is repreſented to thee. When thou art wronged, then is thy ſeaſon to demonſtrate thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and mercy in forgiving. When thou ſeeſt a <hi>Samaritane</hi> lie wounded, then is the opportunity of thy pouring in wine and oyl: and, when thy brother falleth into ſin, there is the opportunity for exerciſing thy brotherly help to <hi>reſtore</hi> him <hi>in the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> Galat. 6. 1.

                  <p>2. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> of every week. That ſhould eſpecially be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,</hi>

And yet there is a Divine ſtamp and impreſſion upon this day; and that it be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by us, all the quitie in the world calls for it, God having indulged us the reſt of the week for our ſelves and callings; and ſo we ſee the Apoſtles care was to <hi>redeem</hi> it wholly to <hi>holy</hi> exerciſes; <hi>upon the firſt day of the week, the diſciples came together, for breaking of bread, and preaching,</hi> &amp;c.

As Merchants are at charge for their merchandize, they are oft laying out their treaſure, have many a troubleſome voyage and reſtleſs nights, for the ſecuring and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of their merchandizes: ſo ſhould Chriſtians ſpare ſome of their lawfull pleaſures and recreations of their natural reſt and ſleep, that they may <hi>redeem</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> their <hi>time;</hi> which is not onely <hi>non abuti occaſione, ſed etiam mille voluptatibus redimere,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> gloſſeth.

                     </gap>, (the ſame word that is in our Text). How ſo? He parted with all, pleaſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, life and all, for the accompliſhment of this end: ſo ſhould we in an ingenuous return of gratitude, part with our pleaſures and all, that we may conſecrate our time to his ſervice.

                  <p>Seventhly, An act of <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> in avoiding what may betray us to the <hi>miſpence</hi> of <hi>time:</hi> ſuch are eſpecially <hi>frothy</hi> and <hi>idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>looſe company.</hi> A Merchant will not engage himſelf in <hi>impertinent diſcourſe,</hi> or <hi>voluptuous companie,</hi> when he ſhould be driving on his <hi>trade.</hi> Theſe every man muſt avoid, that would <hi>redeem</hi> his <hi>time;</hi> for <hi>bad companie</hi> draws into ſin and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: upon this account God forbad the <hi>nations</hi> to dwell with the Jews, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 33. therefore <hi>David</hi> would have no <hi>commerce</hi> with ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 115. as if he could not ſpend his time in the ſervice of God, while ſuch were in his companie. <hi>Idle company</hi> is the <hi>ſhame</hi> of <hi>Societies,</hi> the <hi>bane</hi> of <hi>pietie,</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>youth,</hi> the <hi>quencher</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> the <hi>laviſher</hi> of <hi>time.</hi> He that deſires to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident</hi> of his <hi>time,</hi> muſt be prudent in the choiſe of his <hi>Societie,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in <hi>bad company,</hi> he may quickly throw awaytime, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſoul, eternitie and all.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, An act of <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>reſolved</hi> judgement, to <hi>lay out</hi> our <hi>time</hi> for the <hi>beſt things.</hi> As a Merchant will not expend his time and money for <hi>toyes</hi> and <hi>trifles,</hi> but for <hi>pearls,</hi> and the like. <hi>Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sè merces conſiderat ut emat meliores,</hi> ſaith <hi>A Lapide</hi> on the Text; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines his wares, that he may purchaſe the beſt:</hi> ſo ſhould Chriſtians in laying out their time, not lay it out for trifles of the world, but for the greateſt things of eternitie: not with <hi>Martha</hi> for the <hi>many things,</hi> but with <hi>Mary</hi> for the <hi>one thing neceſſarie.</hi> The Merchant in the Goſpel indeed <hi>ſold all,</hi> but it was to purchaſe the <hi>pearl:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> counted all <hi>loſs,</hi> but it was to <hi>gain</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. Thoſe who ſpend their time for the vanities of the world, for the light air of popular applauſe, for the ſhadow of honour, riches, or the like (not to mention the debaſing of their ſouls, which are born to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hopes and deſigns): they throw away their time, and often their ſouls, in ſuch bargains: to whom let me ſay with the Prophet <hi>Eſay, 55. 2. Wherefore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> We are here at <hi>Athens,</hi> that <hi>Emporium ſcientiarum,</hi> trafficking for wiſdome and knowledge; but let me ſuggeſt this, We do but throw away our times, though laboriouſly ordered to this end, if in the mean time we are careleſs of ſpiritual wiſdome: <hi>Thoſe merchandizes are better then the merchandizes of ſilver, and her gain then of fine gold,</hi> Prov. 3. 14.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57001:55"/> every day he ſpent three hours in prayer, <hi>etiam ſtudiis aptiſsimas,</hi> even thoſe that were fitteſt for his ſtudies: and it was his uſual ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Bene orâſſe eſt bene ſtuduiſſe: to pray well,</hi> with him, <hi>was to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die well.</hi> Prayer is as oyl to the <hi>lamp,</hi> makes it burn clearly, and laſtingly. So again, if our ſollicitude for other knowledge makes us neglect, and regardleſs of our knowledge of Chriſt. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gat much knowledge at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but when he came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand himſelf, he counted it all <hi>droſs</hi> for the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. If we would be wiſe Merchants, we muſt trade for heaven and eternitie, and lay up our treaſure there, and amidſt our heats, and purſuits of other knowledge, lay out our time and prayers eſpecially for the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>whom onely to know is life eternal,</hi> John 17. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Conſider, Chriſt ſpent all his time in the world for thee: from his birth (<hi>To us a childe is born;</hi> Iſaiah 9. 6.) to his death, he died <hi>for our offences,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. His ſoul was in a <hi>continual travel</hi> to ſave thee: and ſhall not this engage thee? Chriſts life was a continual labour to redeem <hi>thee;</hi> and ſhall not this ingage thee to redeem <hi>thy time,</hi> and expend thy life in his ſervice? In this he was a <hi>pattern,</hi> and example for our imitation. The Apoſtle judgeth this to be the moſt reaſonable thing in the world, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. For the love of Christ conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge: that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them.</hi> So that miſpence of our time is not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable to our <hi>creation,</hi> but unworthy, and unſuitable to the work of our <hi>redemption.</hi> For he <hi>gave himſelf for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14.

Our time is not at our own diſpoſe to be laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in purſuance of our own luſts and deſigns, but a <hi>talent</hi> to be improved for our Maſters glorie. And as he expected ſuitable <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> according to the number of <hi>talents,</hi> delivered to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Matt,</hi> 25. 15. according as one, or more: ſo as God gives us the longer time, the more years, he expects our improvement of it: every day is a <hi>talent</hi> of <hi>time</hi> put into our hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he expects we ſhould every day improve it. Nay,</p>
                  <p>7. Conſider, <hi>Time</hi> is ſuch a <hi>talent,</hi> upon the faithful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, <hi>depends</hi> the <hi>improvement</hi> of all our other <hi>talents,</hi> God intruſts us with, whether <hi>gifts</hi> or <hi>graces. Action,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, ſo it increaſes, ſtrengthens, and ſecures the <hi>habits</hi> which are loſt and weakned, not onely by contrarie actions, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their proper <hi>act: gifts</hi> decay and wither, <hi>grace</hi> grows dull, and gradually decays, if not acted and improved. The <hi>talent</hi> laid up in the <hi>napkin</hi> you know did not increaſe, no more then if it had been laviſhly ſpent. How many by idleneſs have ſuffered their <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> to ruſt, and by Gods judicial proceeding, have loſt them fearfully! So unexerciſed <hi>grace</hi> is, as comfortleſs, ſo wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; decaying. The <hi>ſword,</hi> that is kept bright by uſing, ruſts in the ſcabbard; and <hi>waters,</hi> which keep ſweet and clean by motion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract filth, and ſtinch by ſtanding; air without motion corrupts, and grows peſtilential; flames not in motion periſh: ſo do mens <hi>gifts</hi> ruſt, and even come to nothing, if not exerciſed. The <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours valour</hi> decays, and is impaired in the garriſon, but is increaſed and quickned in the field and battel. Idleneſs and remiſsneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate the vertues of the ſoul, but they are ſtrengthned by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. As therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi>

                  <p>8. Conſidering, that <hi>time</hi> is ſuch a <hi>talent,</hi> as God will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57001:57"/> call to <hi>account</hi> for. The Apoſtle urgeth an holy improvement of time upon this account. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 42, 5. theſe two verſes compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; one thing God will account for at the great day, will be our <hi>Time.</hi> Oh! how ſad will it be for many gray-heads to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at that day, as old in ſin as years, to anſwer for the expence of three or fourſcore years, which perhaps they have uſeleſsly ſpent in vanitie and ſin? Then God will beſpeak men thus: <hi>Come give me an account of that time, which I gave thee to glorifie me, and to work out thine own ſalvation in, and thou hast been ſpending it in purſuance of the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life.</hi> What a ſad charge will this be at that day to thouſands in the world? Oh that we had hearts to conſider it, before it be too late, while time laſts, before eternitie overtake us! what account ſhall they give of their time, who laviſh it out in idle ſports and paſtimes, in pride, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and vanitie? as that King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> of whom <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Var. hiſt. lib.</hi> 1.</note> who promiſed a large reward to any, who would invent any new ſports and recreations. See how the Wiſe-man checks young men, (who commonly are moſt profuſe, and careleſs of their time) in the midſt of their jollitie with ſuggeſting this account unto them. <hi>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the daies of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine own heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgement,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 9. he ſpeaks by an <hi>Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> conceſſion, <hi>Go on, ſpend your time in vanitie, but after you have done ſo, know for certain you muſt come to judgement.</hi>

Now the door of mercie ſtands open, therefore we ſhould not, with the <hi>fooliſh virgins,</hi> ſleep away this time, leſt the door be ſhut againſt us, as it was againſt them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 10. So as <hi>Eſau,</hi> who loſt the bleſſing, becauſe he came to late: this is the time of our reprieve allotted unto us, in which to ſue out our pardon: <hi>Account that the long-ſuffering of the Lord is ſalvation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 15. <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

Every man is naturally apt to applaud the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and birth of his own phanſie and imagination (ſo the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> thinks his <hi>black</hi> the greateſt beautie) and through <hi>pride</hi> (which is the <hi>womb</hi> of errour) to vent and broach this phanſie, though to the diſquiet of the Church: therefore, if not reſtrained by fear (for men naturally are ſlaviſh, not ingenuous) much more if pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly authorized, (uſually it appears with the face of authority) and the devil will be ſure to promote it; he will ſend up the <hi>ſmoke</hi> of the <hi>bottomleſs pit,</hi> to obſcure the <hi>beauty of truth;</hi> he will get in his <hi>cloven</hi> foot, and <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>ſeamleſs</hi> coat, it being the <hi>maxime</hi> of his Politicians, <hi>Divide &amp; Impera, Divide and Rule:</hi> and here indeed is the ſource of all the errours of our times. Now then we, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſpirit</hi> was <hi>ſtirred</hi> in him, to ſee the idolatry of <hi>Athens;</hi> and whoſe zeal would not ſuffer him to do any thing <hi>againſt the truth,</hi> but all <hi>for it;</hi> we ſhould lay out our time to fit our ſelves with weapons to fight againſt errour, and defend the truth, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Sathans devices. S. <hi>Paul</hi> met with many oppoſitions;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57001:59"/> ſometimes he had to do with looſe <hi>Libertines,</hi> who made the <hi>free grace</hi> he preached, a cloak of maliciouſneſs: another while with proud Phariſaical <hi>Juſticiaries,</hi> who denied <hi>grace,</hi> and cried up <hi>works:</hi> the Apoſtle was to grapple with both theſe, and ſo he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured <hi>more abundantly then all.</hi> The great Controverſie of the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10</note> former age was with the proud <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with the <hi>beaſt</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But he that will look now into the miniſterie, muſt reckon to deal with the ſubtil <hi>Socinian,</hi> the looſe <hi>Antinomian,</hi> the canting <hi>Quaker,</hi> the petulant <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> the conceited <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt,</hi> the muddie <hi>Atheiſt:</hi> we had need to provide our weapons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go into the field; and, having ſo many ſpiritual <hi>Goliahs</hi> to encounter withall, it is our concernment and duty, to get our <hi>ſling,</hi> and our <hi>ſmooth ſtones</hi> out of the <hi>brook</hi> of the Scriptures, by which we may ſtrike them in the <hi>fore-head:</hi> yea, and to go down to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to <hi>ſharpen our weapons,</hi> I mean to furniſh our ſelves with <hi>tongues</hi> and <hi>ſciences,</hi> and <hi>rational improvements,</hi> to enervate the ſtrength and ſubtilties, and detect the vizards and fallacies, which errour uſually puts on to delude the ignorant and inconſiderate. Scarce any of the Fathers had ſo many errours to oppoſe as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine;</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Manichee</hi> on the other: ſo none more laborious then he, having left us many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his unwearied diligence; whence he was ſtiled, <hi>Malleus haereticorum.</hi> Now ſo many endeavour to raſe the foundation, the ſpiritual builders ſhould labour more in edifying the truth, and Church of God: the creeping in of ſo many <hi>wolves</hi> into the <hi>flock</hi> ſhould put the <hi>Paſtours</hi> upon more vigilancy, and diligence; now the darkneſs of errour, and night of ignorance is upon us: how ſhould theſe ſtars ſhine in the firmament of the Church? And while others, ſo many <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>Tobiahs,</hi> endeavour to obſtruct, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and overthrow the truth, we ſhould endeavour to lay out our time to enoble and patronize it.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>open</hi> and <hi>abounding profaneneſs</hi> that is among us, that <hi>Atheiſme, licentiouſneſs, contempt of God</hi> and <hi>his word,</hi> and thoſe other <hi>crying</hi> ſins, which run in the midſt of the nation, ſhould powerfully provoke us to <hi>redeem</hi> our <hi>time:</hi> and that upon a fourefold account.</p>
                  <p>1. That we may <hi>diſcountenance</hi> and give a <hi>check</hi> to <hi>profaneneſs,</hi> that our lives may be a conſtant <hi>ſtanding</hi> reproofe to the wickedneſs of the times, ſo the Apoſtle in this 5. of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> enjoynes at ver. 11. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them:</hi> but how ſhall that be done? he tells us at ver. 8. <hi>walk as the children of light:</hi> and <hi>Philip. 2. 15. that ye may ſhine as lights amidſt a crooked and perverſe generation.</hi> The more others laviſh out and miſpend this time in looſe and licentious walking; the more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57001:60"/> ſhould we endeavour to redeem it by a ſtrict, and conſcientious converſation.</p>
                  <p>2. It will be a <hi>Chriſtians praiſe</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> in <hi>bad times,</hi> to be <hi>good husbands</hi> when others are <hi>prodigals</hi> about us. Thus S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives a reaſon, why God permitted <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt to be tempted, <hi>That he might have had the more glory, if he had uſed his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libertie to reſiſt and withſtand that temptation. Non mihi videtur,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>magnae laudis fuiſſe futurum hominem, ſi propterea poſset bene vivere, quia nemo malè vivere ſuaderet.</hi> It is leſs commendation to be good when we have no temptation to be bad: but when in licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious times, being on every ſide ſurrounded with temptations, we go ſtill on in a way of holineſs; this is our juſt <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> as it was of <hi>Lot,</hi> to be righteous in the midſt of unclean <hi>Sodome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In ſuch times we are in moſt <hi>danger</hi> to be <hi>miſled. Piſcator</hi> gives this reaſon, why the profaneneſs of the times ſhould put us upon the redeeming of the time: <hi>quia periculum imminet piis à corruptelis mundi.</hi> When it is, as in 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 19. the whole world lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> the beſt are in great danger to be ſeduced, either into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſin, or both: we ſhould therefore <hi>redeem</hi> the <hi>time,</hi> that we may be able to prevent the one, and oppoſe the other.</p>
                  <p>4. Our <hi>redeeming</hi> the <hi>time</hi> may make the times <hi>better.</hi> It is the evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> that make the <hi>dayes</hi> evil. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>perillous times</hi> which ſhould be in the <hi>laſt dayes,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. he tells you the reaſon of it, in verſes 2, 3, 4, 5. the latter of which, (viz. <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power</hi>) I fear hath a great influence upon the evil of our dayes. Now the onely way to amend the times, is to amend our ſelves. God would ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>times,</hi> if once the <hi>men</hi> that live in the times were amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was good counſel <hi>Daniel</hi> gives to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthning of thy tranquillity.</hi> All men cry out of the <hi>times;</hi> but who cry out of, or leave their <hi>ſins,</hi> which make the times ſo bad? When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſinned in <hi>making the calf, Moſes</hi> ſpends his time in prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. It was <hi>Achans</hi> wedge, that made it a <hi>bad</hi> day to <hi>Iſreal:</hi> when he was removed, God was appeaſed, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. Our times are evil; let us not repiningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond or quarrel, but let us lay out our time in prayer and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to make them better. And ſo much of the ſecond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

                  <p>I. <hi>Young ones.</hi> Theſe ſhould eſpecially <hi>redeem</hi> their <hi>time. Young</hi> Merchants are moſt vigorous and active in their trading. It is the <hi>Wiſemans</hi> counſel, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 1: Remember thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth:</hi> it briefly ſuggeſts ſeveral conſiderations, which may provoke youth to a diligent <hi>improvement</hi> of their <hi>time:</hi> as,</p>
                  <p>1. Conſider, This is moſt <hi>worthy of,</hi> and moſt <hi>acceptable unto</hi> God, to give <hi>him</hi> the beſt of our time, <hi>who</hi> beſt deſerves it: it is moſt unworthy of God, to give him our feeble age, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath had the ſtrength of our youth ſpent in his ſervice: to give the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of the wine to Satan, and the <hi>dregs</hi> to God. <hi>Nonne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det te id temporis bonae menti reſervare, quod in nullam rem conferre po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt?</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca:</hi> to give to God that time, which the infirmities of age makes uſeleſs for any thing elſe? Give me leave to make<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 8.</note> uſe of that of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> Will the Prince think you entertain a <hi>cripled rebel,</hi> who hath been all his dayes fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him under his enemies colours? Wilt thou give the beſt of thy life unto Satan, be under his ſervice, and think to <hi>liſt</hi> thy ſelf under Chriſts <hi>banner,</hi> to fight the <hi>good fight</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> when thy ſtrength and activity fails thee? <hi>Tunc vivere incipere, cùm deſinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt; &amp; indè velle vitam inchoare, quò pauci produxerunt,</hi> as the Heathen ſayes: <hi>Then to begin to live, when you ſhould die, and to date your life from that time, to which the life but of a few is lengthned.</hi> God, under the Law, would have no <hi>blinde,</hi> or <hi>lame</hi> for <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 21. The <hi>firſt-born</hi> were <hi>holy to God:</hi> and he required not onely the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> but the <hi>firſt</hi> of thoſe <hi>first-fruits,</hi> Exod. 23. 19. All which was to ſignifie unto us, that <hi>young years</hi> offered to God, are a <hi>ſweet-ſmelling</hi> ſavour in his noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>2 Conſider, This is moſt for your <hi>comfort:</hi> that you may in time of age, affliction, and death, with peace and comfort reflect upon your youth, the miſpence whereof does oft cauſe ſad refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſpirit in riper years, and fills the ſoul with horrour and amazement. <hi>Job</hi> was made to <hi>poſſeſs the iniquities of his youth:</hi> his youth had the pleaſure of thoſe ſins, which his age now felt the ſmart of. When <hi>guilt</hi> ſhall flie in the face of an <hi>awakened</hi> conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and God for them ſhall exerciſe the ſoul with <hi>inward</hi> terrours, as <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the condition of a wicked man, <hi>Job 20. 11. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis quas ſibi ſceleribus adoleſcentiae acquiſivit,</hi> ſayes <hi>Beza, with thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,</hi> which are the iſſue of the ſins of youth: nay, though God hath upon your repentance pardoned thoſe ſins, yet he may in old age chaſten thee for them; then you may come ſadly to ſpeak that language, <hi>Rom. 6. 21. What fruit have we in thoſe ſins, whereof we are now aſhamed?</hi> Theſe queſtionleſs coſt <hi>David</hi> many a ſad tear, and mournful prayer, as we ſee in <hi>Pſalm. 25. 7. Remember not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57001:61"/> the ſins of my youth.</hi> As it is in the <hi>body,</hi> licentious <hi>youth</hi> contracts thoſe <hi>diſtempers,</hi> which are the burden and ſorrow of <hi>old age,</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with pains and aches: So it is in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſins,</hi> which by miſpence of time youth ruſh into, may prove the ſorrow and vexation of age: but <hi>well-improved</hi> youth makes age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider, It will be an <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>prevention</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>ſins,</hi> which <hi>youth</hi> is moſt <hi>liable</hi> and <hi>prone</hi> to. Youth having leſs wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to diſcover, and leſs ſtrength to reſiſt and withſtand tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, more open to ſolicitation by reaſon of unruly paſſions, bad examples, and councel of others, is moſt liable to ſin. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 119. 9. theſe being moſt ſubject to defilements: <hi>David</hi> anſwers the queſtion; <hi>By taking heed thereto according to thy word,</hi> and one of the precepts of that word is <hi>To redeem our time.

                  </p>
                  <p>5. Conſider, This will both <hi>ſweeten</hi> and <hi>facilitate</hi> employment to you afterward. The ſins of youth oft make men unſerviceable in riper years, or if repented of and forſaken, yet they are oft a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and diſcouragement to men in their employments. <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> was <hi>aſhamed,</hi> becauſe ſhe <hi>bore the reproach of her youth,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore writing to his young <hi>Timothy</hi> enformes him how to ſecure himſelf from contempt: <hi>Theſe things command and teach,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57001:61"/> ſo, <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thy youth, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 11, 12. Sins of youth lay men open to reproach, even then, when afterwards they prove emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent &amp; ſerviceable in the work of God. Beſides, miſpence of youth muſt neceſſarily make our ſervice and employment abroad more difficult: for men to have their ſeed to ſeek, when a harveſt is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them: whereas your laborious improvement of this time makes ſervice eaſy and familiar, when having laid up a treaſure and ſtock of knowledge he is able, as the Scribe inſtructed to the kingdome of Heaven, <hi>to bring out of his treaſure things new and old.</hi> Matth. 13. 52.</p>
                  <p>6. Redeem this time in <hi>conformity</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>beſt Saints. Chriſt</hi> was at twelve years of age about his <hi>Fathers buſineſs, Luk. 2. 44. Samuel</hi> in his childhood was dedicated to the Lord. 1. <hi>Sam. 1. 28. Timothy</hi> from a child redeemed his time to the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of <hi>the Scripture. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15. And it is recorded as a juſt commendation of that good Prince <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that <hi>while yet young,</hi> he <hi>began to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the God of David his father,</hi> and <hi>at twelve years old</hi> zealously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt Idolatry. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 3. Let us then tread in the footſteps of theſe Saints, and be followers of them, as they were of Chriſt, who redeemed his whole time to the ſervice and glory of his Father.</p>
                  <p>II. The ſecond rank of thoſe who are moſt eſpecially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this is, ſuch <hi>men</hi> as are <hi>of greater abilities and opportunities.</hi> To whom God gives <hi>ten</hi> talents, he expects an improvement from them, anſwerable to that they are intruſted with: the improvement of <hi>five</hi> will not ſerve for him, who hoth received <hi>ten. To whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required, Luc.</hi> 12. 48. Mens great <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> are ready to puff them up with pride: S. <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of this 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. and this is the abuſe of the <hi>gifts</hi> of God, which, if rightly uſed and improved, ſhould not <hi>leaven</hi> us with <hi>pride,</hi> but engage &amp; quicken us to more ſerviceableneſs for God, and not cenſuring the <hi>gifts</hi> of others (by which practiſe we either charge God for giving them no more, or ſacrifice ſacrilegiouſly to our ſelves, that we have ſo much; when as <hi>we have nothing, but what is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>) endeavour to improve, and uſe our own.</p>
                  <p>III. The third rank: ſuch, <hi>who by idleneſs and looſeneſs have miſpent much time formerly:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> urgeth this. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2, 3.

Thoſe eſpecially are engaged, <hi>who live in theſe places,</hi> and that not <hi>onely</hi> becauſe we have <hi>greater opportunities</hi> (of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but <hi>chiefly</hi> becauſe our <hi>improvements</hi> are the <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment</hi> both of Church and State. All mens eyes are fixt upon us, and their expectations are from us, and therefore we muſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> that we may be a credit to our places, and a bleſſing unto the Church, and be able by our ſerviceableneſs, when God calls us out, to give an account of the expence of our time here, by contending for the faith againſt all novel encroachments of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, hereſie, and the like.</p>
                  <p>VI. And laſtly, Thoſe eſpecially, <hi>who have bad experience of the grace of God, who are truely enlightned, and brought home unto Christ.</hi> And therefore you may obſerve, that the Apoſtle urgeth this dutie upon the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> from the conſideration of their <hi>regenerate</hi> condition, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 8. Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57001:62"/> in the Lord;</hi> therefore it follows, <hi>walk as children of the light:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving again ſaid at <hi>ver. 14. Awake thou that ſleepest, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give the light;</hi> it follows in <hi>ver. 15. walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, not as fools</hi> (as formerly, miſpending, and laviſhing out your precious time) <hi>but as wiſe;</hi> and that hath reference to this, <hi>Redeeming your time.</hi> So the Apoſtle elſewhere frequently argues from the <hi>change</hi> of our <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> to the <hi>change</hi> of our <hi>converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> ſo <hi>Rom. 13. 11. And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep: for now is our ſalvation nearer:</hi> and at <hi>verſe 12. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light,</hi> &amp;c. However men<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 23.</note> ſleep in the <hi>night,</hi> yet when the <hi>Sun</hi> ariſeth, <hi>man goeth forth unto his labour;</hi> ſo however men idle in the night of their <hi>unregeneracte,</hi> when the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs is riſen</hi> upon them, then they muſt <hi>up</hi> and <hi>be working.</hi> Obſerve again, how the Apoſtle urges this in 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 5, 6. Ye are all children of the light, and of the day, we are not of the night, nor of the darkneſs: Therefore let us not ſleep, as do others, but let us watch, &amp; be ſober.</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, that had <hi>wickedly</hi> miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent his time, in perſecuting of the Church, and blaſpheming God, when once he was brought home, deſires to improve it for God: and therefore calls out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and this<note place="margin">Acts. 9. 16.</note> briefly upon theſe conſiderations, which I do but <hi>touch,</hi> and leave to your ſelves to be <hi>enlarged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>They have more to improve then others.</hi> They have not onely <hi>common gifts,</hi> but a talent of <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> which they ſhould trade with, and endeavour to improve.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>They have the greateſt mercie to engage them.</hi> The <hi>Wiſeman</hi> urges it upon ſome, in conſideration of the great work of <hi>creation,</hi>

                     <hi>Remember thy Creatour in the days of thy youth:</hi> how much more ſhould an intereſt in the work of <hi>redemption</hi> wrought by Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage unto this? he having <hi>redeemed</hi> us to this end, that we might <hi>redeem our time</hi> for <hi>his ſervice,</hi> Luke 1. 74.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>They have the greateſt hopes in their eyes to encourage them.</hi> Conſider, how laborious and diligent he will be, who hath the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a <hi>kingdome</hi> in his eyes: and ſhould not Chriſtians much more, eyeing their inheritance incorruptible, and that kingdome, which fadeth not away: <hi>For which cauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we faint not,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. but upon what ground? becauſe <hi>we know that he, which raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus,</hi> verſe 14. and, <hi>we look not at the things which are ſeen, which are but temporal, but at the things which are not ſeen, which are eternal,</hi> verſe 18.</p>
                  <p>4. They are beſt able to judge of the <hi>pretiouſneſs</hi> of time, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57001:63"/> how much it is their concernment to improve it, they having the glory of God, and their own ſalvation in their eye; they know what the miſpence of time means; it hath been the burden of their ſpirit, and the ſadneſs of their ſouls; they know and ſee into the danger of laviſhing out their time, which others, who diſcern none of theſe, prodigally throw away.</p>
                  <p>5. And laſtly, Their <hi>miſ-improvement</hi> of time is the greateſt <hi>ſcandal</hi> unto others. Every one is apt to take offence at, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves in looſneſs by, the remiſſneſs and idleneſs of thoſe, who own Chriſt, and profeſs the Goſpel. <hi>When my foot ſlippeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 38. 16.</note> ſaith <hi>David, they magnifie themſelves againſt me.</hi> So the Apoſtle tels us of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. that <hi>the name of God was blaſphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles through them.</hi> And, how apt are men to take an occaſion by our idleneſs to reproach Learning, and Religion too? The Apoſtle therefore, with whom I ſhall conclude the Doctrinal part of theſe words, exhorts; <hi>Walk in wiſdome towards them that are without, Redeeming the time,</hi> Coloſſ. 4. 5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The improvement of this by ſome Application.<note place="margin">4 <hi>General. Application.</hi>
                     </note> And the Application of this ſhall be onely twofold.</p>
                  <p>1. To <hi>check</hi> and <hi>reprove</hi> mens <hi>miſpence,</hi> and <hi>miſ-improvement</hi> of their <hi>time.</hi> Nothing more precious, yet nothing leſs regarded: may we not complain of many, who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, as <hi>Seneca</hi> does of the Heathens; <hi>Magna pars vitae malè agentibus, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xima</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>nihil agentibus, tota aliud agentibus dilabitur.</hi> We hold our time of God, as our great <hi>Landlord,</hi> and how are moſt like to bad <hi>Tenants,</hi> who return little or no homage to him for it: but improve Gods talents in the devils ſervice. <hi>Quem mihi dabis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, qui aliquod temporis pretium ponat, qui diem aeſtimat: Where ſhall we finde a man, who ſets a due value and eſtimate upon his time?</hi> What between doing nothing, and that which is worſe then nothing, ſin, moſt mens time ſlips away. I onely ſuggeſt unto you this; Time will have an end ſpeedily, and what will you do, when God calls to an account of that time which you have ſpent upon your luſts, and though it may ſeem to have been pleaſant, yet without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it will be very ſad: even as it fared with thoſe jolly ones, in <hi>Job 21. 12, 13. They take the timbrel, and harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the organ. They ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave:</hi> and well were it for them, if they might reſt there; but it will be more horrible, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 30 of that chapter, <hi>The wicked is reſerved to the day of deſtruction, they ſhall be brought forth unto the day of wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To <hi>quicken</hi> us to a <hi>conſcientious performance</hi> of this duty by a <hi>laborious improvement</hi> of our time. This the Apoſtle preſſes, 1.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57001:63"/> 
                     <hi>Theſſ. 4. 11. That ye ſtudy to be quiet, and do your own buſineſs:</hi> and again in 2 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 10, 11. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat: For we hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Diſorderly walking, eſpecially in miſpending, and miſ-improving our time, is very unſuitable to a Chriſtian. I ſhall therefore ſhew you briefly, to what end, and how you ſhould improve your time conſcientiouſly, and ſo diſmiſs the Text. It muſt be done,</p>
                  <p>I. To the <hi>glory of God: Whatſoever you do,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>do all to the glory of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Did we conſider this in the improving our time in our ſtudies, and ask our ſelves this queſtion, <hi>Can God have any glory from this kinde of ſtudie?</hi> it would certainly cut off the ſtudy of many unprofitable, impertinent, idle books, which inable men onely for ſome idle frothy diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the great God, Time is Gods creature, and his <hi>talent,</hi> therefore to be imployed onely to his <hi>glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. To the <hi>good of others.</hi> So the Apoſtle expreſſely, <hi>Gal. 6. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: While we have time, let us do good unto all.</hi> That <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour ſet a juſt eſtimate upon his time, who accounted <hi>that day loſt, in which he had done no good unto ſome.</hi> This concerns thoſe eſpecially, who are intruſted with the care of others. <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Hodie non imperavi, quia nemini benefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci:</hi> a ſpeech worthy of an Emperour, whoſe chief care ſhould be for the publick good; ſo ſhould we alſo, who are entruſted with the care of others, account that day <hi>miſ-ſpent,</hi> in which we have not endeavored ſome way to <hi>better</hi> them, <hi>Ut non negligunt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem lucrifaciendi errantes, incredulos, inter quos vivebant,</hi> ſayes <hi>Muſculus:</hi> ſo alſo the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Coloſſ. 4. 5. Walk wiſely to them that are without, redeeming the time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. <hi>To our own ſalvation,</hi> neglecting no opportunity whereby we may promote it, willingly engaging in every dutie and practiſe, which hath a tendencie to it: thus <hi>working out our ſalvation with</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Job 24. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will do no more,</hi> that is, in miſpending, and miſ-improving our time, but in the preſent redeeming of it. It is one of the <hi>maſter-pieces</hi> of Satan, to deſtroy ſoules, by tempting them to defer and delay the improvement of their time, ſuggeſting
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57001:64"/> unto them, <hi>It will be time enough afterward:</hi> thus the yong <hi>Gallant</hi> is perſwaded to ſpend his time in <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> till he hath none left to <hi>pray, repent,</hi> and <hi>return</hi> in. As a cunning uſurer flatters his debtour, tells him <hi>all will be well,</hi> till he hath failed his day, and then ſeizeson his land: ſo Satan flatters men into ſecurity, perſwades them that they have day <hi>enough</hi> before them, till they have ſinned away their day of <hi>grace,</hi> ſo God is provoked at laſt to give them up to that maſter, whom they have ſerved all their time, to receive their wages in eternity of miſery. Curſed be that Proverb, <hi>A young Saint, an old Devil:</hi> you do not oft ſee <hi>young Devils</hi> prove <hi>old Saints. Solomon</hi> gives better advice, <hi>Prov. 22. 6. Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will never depart from it:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, It is good for a man, that he bear</hi>

Eccleſ. 11. 4. <hi>He that obſerveth the wind, ſhall not ſow, and he that regardeth the clouds ſhall not reap;</hi> and he that makes difficulty an argument againſt duty, ſhall never perform any. Difficulties ſhould make a Chriſtian more diligent and watchfull, not more ſecure, and careleſs. <hi>Solomon</hi> marks him for a <hi>ſluggard,</hi> that pretends <hi>a lion in the way,</hi> why he ſhould not <hi>go forward,</hi> Prov. 22. 13. <hi>Cùm ità corruptum eſt ſeculum, videtur diabolus tyrannidem occupare, ut non poſsit tempus Deo conſecrari, niſi quodammodo redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum,</hi> ſo <hi>Calvin.

                     <p>In this it is neceſſarie to ſpeak diſtinctly, thereby to correct thoſe common miſtakes whereby moſt men do dangerouſly delude themſelves. One <hi>remembers</hi> the Text; a ſecond picks a <hi>flower</hi> of Rhetorick; a third runs away with a <hi>notion;</hi> a fourth <hi>admires</hi> the preacher; a fifth gets a little floating <hi>head-knowledge;</hi> a ſixth makes a few formal <hi>reſolutions;</hi> a ſeventh is ſomewhat <hi>moved</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> at a Sermon; another laſtly <hi>praiſeth</hi> the <hi>quaintneſs</hi> and <hi>elegancie</hi> of the preacher: and each of theſe thinks himſelf abundantly <hi>profited</hi> by the Word.</p>
                     <p>It is then,</p>
                     <p>I. Not to <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> a mans ſelf in <hi>the world</hi> by the profeſſion and conſtant hearing of the Word: though this be all the profit they look after, <hi>who count gain godlineſs.</hi> Men care for<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5.</note> the Goſpel no longer then it is conſiſtent with their wordly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, who when they come to ſerve God in attendance upon his word, ſecretly ſacrifice to the Idol <hi>Self,</hi> and propound no more to themſelves, then <hi>ſecular</hi> advantages. <hi>Quantas nobis divitias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paravit haec fabula Chriſti?</hi> as <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was oft heard to ſay. Men may eſteem the Goſpel but a <hi>Fable,</hi> and yet adhere to it for <hi>outward</hi> advantages; care not for <hi>Diana,</hi> but her <hi>ſilver-ſhrines;</hi> that affect not the Goſpel ſo much, as that <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> it brings them in. That this is the temper of many, is evident from this; that if the world ſolicites <hi>Demas,</hi> he forſakes <hi>Paul;</hi> the Scribe<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. Mat. 8.</note> cares not for following Chriſt, though he profeſſe zealouſly, when once he underſtood he had not where to <hi>lay his head;</hi> and many ſuch followers we have, like thoſe, <hi>John</hi> 6. 26. who followed Chriſt, not for <hi>love</hi> to his <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>doctrine,</hi> but for the gain of the <hi>loaves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. Not to <hi>admire</hi> or <hi>praiſe</hi> the <hi>preacher.</hi> The Church is not a <hi>Theater,</hi> but a <hi>Market;</hi> and it is not a <hi>plaudite</hi> that's expected from you, to cloſe the Sermon with a <hi>humme;</hi> but that you ſhould be trading here for ſpiritual merchandize; that you may go from hence richer in <hi>faith,</hi> and more encreaſed in all <hi>grace. Ezekiels</hi> preaching was to the Jews as a very <hi>pleaſant ſong,</hi> yet they profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by it, for they did not <hi>practiſe,</hi> but their hearts went after their <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31, 32. So oft as you <hi>approve</hi> the <hi>Preacher</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and do not ſo <hi>profit</hi> as to <hi>practiſe</hi> it, you are ſelf-condemned, and guiltie in the judgement of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
                     <p>III. Not <hi>onely</hi> to be enlightned by the Word. I know <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57001:68"/> illumination</hi> is the <hi>firſt work</hi> of the Spirit by the Word, where it ſavingly profits; S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to the Gentiles firſt to <hi>open their eyes:</hi> but that which I here aſſert is, that there may much <hi>common illumination</hi> be wrought by the Word of God, where it doth not <hi>ſavingly</hi> profit. It is moſt evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. where we read of ſome who were <hi>once enlightned,</hi> yet in a poſſibilitie to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatize,</hi> and <hi>fall away,</hi> and that beyond the <hi>renewing to repentance,</hi> ſo conſequently of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> And indeed, <hi>this</hi> illumination is one requiſite in the <hi>unpardonable</hi> ſin, it muſt be after the <hi>knowledge of the truth,</hi> Heb. 10. 26. A man may have his head full of the word of God, and be never the better for it. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was wrought into an <hi>hiſtorical</hi> belief by the preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> yet not <hi>ſavingly</hi> profited by it, but ſtil remained in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs,</hi> Acts 8. 13, 23. A man may be <hi>enlightned</hi> to <hi>know,</hi> and to <hi>diſcourſe</hi> of the Word of God, and yet not <hi>ſavingly</hi> profited by it.</p>
                     <p>IV. Not <hi>barely</hi> to be <hi>affected</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> with the Word of God. This may ariſe not from the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Word, but from the <hi>ſublimity</hi> of the truths contained in it. For <hi>truth,</hi> the <hi>more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi> it is, the <hi>greater delight</hi> it bringeth with it; but this is neither <hi>ſolid</hi> nor <hi>laſtin:</hi> thoſe who receive the <hi>ſeed</hi> into <hi>stony</hi> places, were ſuch as <hi>heard and received the word with joy,</hi> but they were but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>III. When it <hi>nouriſheth.</hi> This is conſequent upon the former, the Word then profits, when it is not onely as an <hi>immortal ſeed</hi> to<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23. Ibid. 2. 2.</note>

                     <p>Thirdly, As <hi>Phyſick.</hi> I. When it <hi>ſearcheth.</hi> As when <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick mixeth</hi> and meets <hi>with</hi> the <hi>humour,</hi> it <hi>gripes</hi> and puts the <hi>patient</hi>

So did <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, when it met with the particular corruption of the Jews of <hi>crucifying</hi> Chriſt, it <hi>pricked them at the heart,</hi> Acts 2. 37. When <hi>Pauls</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe meets with a <hi>Felix's injuſtice</hi> and <hi>intemperance,</hi> it gripes him<note place="margin">Acts 24. 52.</note> ſo, that he <hi>trembles.</hi> That <hi>Phyſick</hi> works not <hi>kindly,</hi> which doth not make the <hi>patient</hi> ſick: The Word of God then operates <hi>kindly,</hi> when it makes the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſick of ſin. But this is not enough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>II. When it <hi>purgeth</hi> and <hi>heals.</hi> And to this end, it muſt be <hi>mixed</hi> too. As there muſt be due <hi>ingredients</hi> in every <hi>potion,</hi> ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deſigned for the Cure of each diſeaſe: ſo there muſt be in the Word of God; and this requires much ſpiritual skill in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> phyſician.

There is a <hi>healing</hi> vertue in the Word of God, whence perhaps it is that the Scripture is called, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>I. The <hi>Miniſter.</hi> For I think he cannot plead not guilty in this particular. But as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> when he ſaw a <hi>looſe ſcholar</hi> to be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, charged the <hi>Master;</hi> ſo when we ſee ſo many <hi>unprofitable hearers,</hi> we may in a great meaſure charge and blame the <hi>Preacher,</hi> and that in theſe ten reſpects,</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57001:70"/> affirm to be one reaſon why the Word profits ſo little.</p>
                     <p>It might ſeem a digreſſion from the Text, but I am ſure not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the times, if I ſhould enter a diſcourſe of the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of a <hi>lawful call,</hi> in order to the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> and to enquire whether to <hi>preach</hi> without it be not <hi>a neglect</hi> of a <hi>divine ordinance</hi> and <hi>inſtitution,</hi> a <hi>cloſing</hi> with and <hi>gratifying</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Socinian,</hi> a <hi>contradicting</hi> the <hi>univerſal practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>violating</hi> the <hi>rule,</hi> of <hi>prudence, order,</hi> and <hi>right reaſon,</hi> a <hi>proſtrating</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>expoſing</hi> the <hi>function</hi> to <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>laying</hi> it <hi>open</hi> to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> of every <hi>pretender</hi> to gifts. But I ſhall onely at preſent in all ſubmiſſion propound theſe two <hi>Queries</hi> as to the point in hand, and wholly ſubmit them to your judgement.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Whether he, who preacheth without a lawful call and Commiſsion, can pray in faith for a bleſsing on what he preacheth, as an ordinance of God in reference to the end of preaching, which is Converſion of ſouls?</hi> If he can, he muſt have ſome <hi>promiſe</hi> to ground that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> upon, which the Scripture, I dare ſay, affords not; nay, God ſaith the contrary of <hi>thoſe</hi> Prophets, <hi>Jer. 23. 32. I ſent them not, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all:</hi> and if it be ſaid theſe were <hi>falſe</hi> Prophets who propheſied <hi>lies,</hi> I wiſh it were not the <hi>caſe</hi> of our pretenders, who are generally <hi>broachers</hi> of ſome <hi>groſs</hi> errour; But however it is to be obſerved, that their not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting is not charged upon the <hi>falſity</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but their <hi>want</hi> of <hi>ſending,</hi> and being <hi>commiſsionated</hi> to the office. An <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> is not like to treat <hi>effectually</hi> on terms of <hi>peace,</hi> if he <hi>neglects</hi> his <hi>Commiſsion:</hi> no more are thoſe who negotiate upon termes of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> of <hi>ſinners</hi> to God, who <hi>run</hi> without <hi>ſending.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Whether for the people to expect profit by ſuch, be not to look for Gods bleſsing out of Gods way?</hi> That Scripture is expreſs <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. where if the Apoſtles gradation were rational it muſt argues a <hi>neceſſary</hi> a dependance of <hi>preaching</hi> upon <hi>ſending;</hi> as of <hi>hearing</hi> upon <hi>preaching;</hi> as of <hi>faith</hi> upon <hi>hearing,</hi> viz. all in an <hi>ordinary</hi> way of Gods diſpenſation. Not to limit God, but that he may work by <hi>extraordinary</hi> means, but for us to expect them, when we may have <hi>ordinary</hi> means according to <hi>divine inſtitution</hi> to patronize encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>diſorder</hi> in the Church and plainly to tempt God; No <hi>Manna</hi> in <hi>Canaan</hi> where you may <hi>plow</hi> and <hi>ſow:</hi> No depending on <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> workings (and ſuch muſt the profit by unſent preachers be, if ever it be) where God affords us <hi>ordinary</hi> means of our ſpiritual proficiency.</p>
                     <p>Till I can ſatiſfie my ſelf in theſe two doubts, I muſt reſolve the <hi>unprofitableneſs</hi> of the Word into the <hi>preaching unſent.</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if any think otherwiſe here, though I with that learned

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Miniſters neglect of private prayer that the word may profit.</hi> A <hi>duty</hi> cetainly much imcumbent on the diſpenſers of the Word of God, in reference to the ſpiritual advantage of the people; for this cauſe <hi>Paul bowed his knee</hi> to God for his <hi>Epheſians.</hi> The<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 14. 1.

Thoſe that carry this <hi>lamp</hi> to enlighten others, muſt keep it alive by the <hi>oyl</hi> of <hi>devotion.</hi> The neglect of <hi>prayer</hi> is the Miniſters <hi>ſin,</hi> and a prejudice to the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the word he preacheth; as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid; 1 Sam. 12. 23. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin against the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you; but I will teach you the good and the right way.</hi> You ſee praying and teaching muſt go together.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Many do not preach what for the matter of them can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit:</hi> whileſt neglecting the wholeſome word of God, they elevate the hearer into a ſtupid ignorant <hi>admiration, ſoaring</hi> aloft in the <hi>clouds</hi> in high <hi>Platonical</hi> notions, and abſtruſe <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> abſtract ſpeculations, with which they ſtretch their own, and break their <hi>auditories</hi> brain to conceive, which may gratifie an <hi>humour,</hi> pleaſe an <hi>itching ear,</hi> ſatisfie a <hi>nice curioſity,</hi> feed the <hi>phanſie,</hi> but never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and nouriſh the ſoul, which comes hungring to the <hi>ordinance.</hi> For ſouls, as <hi>Clement</hi> ſaith, have <gap reason="foreign">

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks about <hi>ſtriving about words to no profit, but ſubverting the hearers,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 14. it is the Word of God which is the proper food for ſouls to thrive by; this is a ſpiritual <hi>paradiſe,</hi> the flowers of which have not onely <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Affectation of popular applauſe and credit,</hi> which purs the preacher upon ſtudying more what may pleaſe, then what may profit. <hi>A doctore glorioſo,</hi> was one of thoſe things which <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to pray God to deliver his Church from, from <hi>vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preachers;</hi> ſuch as he elſewhere calls <hi>Theologi gloriae,</hi> and gives this deſcription of them, <hi>dicant malum bonum, &amp; bonum malum, they can call good evil, and evil good;</hi> and then you may eaſily judge how little they are like to profit their hearers. This <hi>affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> makes many both unfaithfull, and unfruitfull in this office: S. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſes this to the ſervice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if they were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. Theſe are like unfaithfull <hi>Embaſſadours,</hi> who, when they are commiſſionated to promote their Princes intereſt, they carrie on their own: or like ill <hi>ſpokes-men,</hi> who being ſent to woo for Chriſt, ſpeak for themſelves onely. I ſpeak not againſt <hi>approbation,</hi> as the reſult of the work, (for which God is pleaſed to <hi>crown</hi> the <hi>laborious,</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> his <hi>faithfull</hi> miniſters) but as the <hi>primarie intention,</hi> or <hi>ultimate end</hi> of the preacher. This is ofteneſt the ſin of young Divines: how oft ha's this put men upon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errour it ſelf, and ſo <hi>poyſoned,</hi> not <hi>profited</hi> their hearers? <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> mentions it as the policie of <hi>Hereticks, neophytos collocare ut gloriâ eos obligent, quia veritate non poſſunt, to promote young upſtarts as the broachers of their Hereſies, that whom truth could not, affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vain-glorie might engage.</hi> It is <hi>hard</hi> what I ſay, not <hi>impoſsible,</hi> to carrie on the <hi>intereſt</hi> of <hi>ſouls,</hi> and our <hi>applauſe</hi> together. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telling the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 8. that he was <hi>affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſirous of them,</hi> he tells you, <hi>verſe 5, 6. we uſed not flattering words, nor of men ſought we glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Ignorance in the diſpencers of the word:</hi> ſuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſcribes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6, 7. who are <hi>deſirous to be teachers</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>understanding neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> Like <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> will needs be <hi>running</hi> upon the <hi>meſſage,</hi> and yet have<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 22</note>

                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Cowardize of preachers:</hi> which makes them afraid to preach what may moſt probably profit their hearers; which upon ſome carnal intereſt or reſpect durſt not reprove ſin, either to ſecure the friendſhip of ſome great one, or the liking and love of the people, and this puts them upon preaching <hi>ſmooth</hi> things, and <hi>placentia,</hi> ſo <hi>ſowing pillows under mens elbows,</hi> and <hi>dawbing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar.

                     <p>Secondly, To the <hi>hearers:</hi> that they would endeavour ſo to hear, that they may profit. For your thriving under means and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting by preaching of the Goſpel, will be,</p>
                     <p>I. A <hi>credit</hi> to the Goſpel, as proclaiming to the world that the Goſpel is more then a <hi>mere notion,</hi> and that there is a <hi>power, virtue,</hi> and <hi>efficacie</hi> in it: while mens unprofitableneſs opens the mouths of the enemies of that Goſpel to charge it as a <hi>humane invention</hi> and <hi>policie</hi> to keep men in aw and ſubjection: but when they ſhall ſee the Goſpel having <hi>a powerfull influence</hi> upon your hearts and lives, they will preſently conclude it to be the <hi>power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>II. The <hi>joy of Angels,</hi> Luke 15. 7. <hi>I ſay unto you likewiſe, joy ſhall be in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more then over ninetie and nine juſt perſons, that need not repentance.</hi> And the means of that is the Word preached, compared to the <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>muſtard-ſeed,</hi> Mat. 13. 31. if you take it down, it will make you weep, as <hi>Peter's</hi> Sermon did the Jews.</p>
                     <p>III. The <hi>advantage and comfort of your Paſtor and Miniſter. I have no greater joy then to hear that my children walk in the truth,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> to his beloved <hi>Caius, 3 John</hi> v. 4. What comfort and joy muſt it needs be to a faithfull Miniſter, to be able to ſay, <hi>Behold, I and the children that God hath given me,</hi> Heb. 2. 13. When he ſhall <hi>ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied.</hi> When with S. <hi>Paul</hi> he can ſay, <hi>Such have I begotten in Chriſt through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls his <hi>converted Philippians</hi> his <hi>crown</hi> and his <hi>joy,</hi> Phil. 4. 1. and his <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> his <hi>glorie</hi> and his <hi>joy, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 20. and as it is his <hi>joy</hi> here, ſo it will be his <hi>comfort</hi> at the laſt day: upon which account the Apoſtle urgeth this upon his <hi>Philippians,</hi> c. 2. v. 16. <hi>holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoyce in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain. holding forth</hi>] viz. <hi>in their lives;</hi> and upon the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 13. 17. Your profiting by the Word will ſeveral waies be the Miniſters advantage; I'le but hint.</p>
                     <p>1. As a <hi>teſtimonie</hi> to the <hi>lawfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of the power of his preaching: and at once a credit both to the Embaſſadour, and his meſſage, the preacher and his Goſpel. The converted <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were the Apoſtles <hi>commendatorie Epistles</hi> to ſet off the worth and efficacie of his Apoſtleſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and he tells them 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 2. the ſeal of my Apostleſhip are ye in the Lord:</hi> as if he had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57001:76"/> ſaid, <hi>your converſion is as undoubted an evidence of the truth of mine Apoſtleſhip, as a Princes ſeal added to letters patent to commiſsionate an Embaſſadour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. As a <hi>ſecuritie</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> to encreaſe thoſe gifts by which he may profit. When a Miniſter ſees no iſſue of his prayers and Sermons of many reſtleſs nights, and wearie daies; how does it diſcourage him in his labours? and while you are <hi>careleſs</hi> to profit, he proves idle in his ſtudie, and negligent to improve his gifts, which conſequently muſt ruſt and decay. An unprofitable hearer oft makes a cold, careleſs, dull preacher, and beſides, God for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs, may withdraw his aſſiſtance and gifts, and <hi>drie up</hi> the <hi>breaſt</hi> for your neglect of the <hi>ſincere milk</hi> of the Word.</p>
                     <p>3. As that which <hi>ſweetens all his enjoyments.</hi> A large revenue, a great living, a fair repute, a fulneſs of outward accomodations, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie not a faithfull Miniſter, while the people remain unprofitable, that he ſees not the fruit of his labours.</p>
                     <p>4. It is <hi>your own concernment and intereſt.</hi> For it is ſad if the Word preached profits you not: for if not <hi>this,</hi> probably <hi>nothing</hi> elſe will: as <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Dives,</hi> ſoliciting for one to be ſent from<note place="margin">Luke 16. 51.</note> the <hi>dead</hi> to his brethren. If the Word profits you not the caſe is deſperate. You had better never have heard of the Word, a <hi>Turk</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> will come off better then you at the <hi>laſt day,</hi> Mat. 10. 14, 15. It will be ſad for <hi>Capernaum, exalted up to heaven</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the word and ordinances at that day, for not <hi>profiting</hi> by them, to be <hi>thrown down to hell:</hi> ſo for thoſe unbelieving Jews here, to whom the Goſpel was preached as well as to us, but <hi>the word did not profit them.</hi>

                        <hi>de ſalute Graeciae,</hi> they all deſerted him. Many can lend an eare to a tale, a fable, or Romance, who are negligent and non-atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon the word of God: and this muſt needs prove unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon a double account.</p>
                     <p>I. It is ſo in the acquiring of all other knowledge, if he that learns regards not what is read unto him (as ſuppoſe a ſcholar his Tutours lectures, or an apprentice his maſters directions) he is not like to profit by them; ſo it is in getting wiſdome by the word of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57001:77"/> God: if we would profit by it, we muſt be ſuch as the Auditours were in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 47, 48. of whom it is ſaid, <hi>they were very attentive to hear him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. When God comes by his Spirit to make the word <hi>effectual</hi> to any ſoul, he raiſeth it to an holy and careful <hi>attention</hi> to the word preached. This is moſt evident in that pregnant place, Act. 16. 14. concerning <hi>Lydia, whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended to the things ſpoken by Paul:</hi> and how oft does our Saviour provoke the attention of his Auditours by this expreſſion, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear?</hi> You muſt bring an holy <hi>attention</hi> of body, and <hi>intention</hi> of minde, if ever you intend <hi>ſavingly</hi> to profit by the word of God: as it is ſaid of thoſe in <hi>Acts 8. 6. They gave heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things which Philip ſpake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The propoſall of wrong ends in hearing:</hi> the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hearers do not propound to themſelves thoſe ends, for which God hath appointed the preaching of the word; ſuch are the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, ſtrengthning, comforting, quickning, convincing</hi> of ſouls; and upon ſearch it will be found, but a few come for thoſe ends. Some come into the Church, as if a man ſhould go into an <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries</hi> ſhop, (not for a medicine to <hi>cure</hi> them, that were well, but) for a <hi>Recipe</hi> to ſleep; I call to witneſs the drowſineſs, and lazineſs of many. Others are <hi>Athenian</hi> Auditours, come onely to <hi>hear ſomething that is new.</hi> Others out of <hi>cuſtome;</hi> becauſe others do,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 21.</note> and themſelves have been accuſtomed to it. Others out of <hi>faſhion,</hi> more then <hi>devotion.</hi> Others come to <hi>contradict</hi> and <hi>oppoſe,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 13. 45. Others, not as they ſhould do, willing to <hi>be judged</hi> by the word of God, but to <hi>judge</hi> it, and the preacher for it; which make the <hi>pulpit,</hi> not a <hi>tribunal</hi> before which they ſhould be judged, but a <hi>bar</hi> before which the preacher muſt be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cenſured, and judged; theſe come to pick a hole in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers coat, not out of a conſcience of their dutie in hearing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God. Others come out of affectation of eloquence, as a man goes to an Oration or Comedy, and then it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that whiles he catches at the ſhadow of Rhetorick (as the dog in the fable) he looſes his ſpiritual food, the <hi>bread of life.</hi> Theſe are like the <hi>proud Greeks,</hi> which ſeek after wiſdome, to whom the <hi>preaching of the Goſpel</hi> ſeems but <hi>fooliſhneſs.</hi> Others come perhaps<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> to promote their intereſt in the world, like thoſe hearers of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6. that followed him for the <hi>loaves.</hi> Others come onely to hear, not to learn or practiſe. <hi>Sicut in theatrum voluptatis</hi>

But you will ſay, <hi>If men come for theſe ends, were it not better that they stay away?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, No, it is ſinfull to come thus in the <hi>circumſtance;</hi> but it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>genere actûs</hi> to neglect coming. However come, though out of <hi>curioſity,</hi> ſo did S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to hear S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> yet was catcht by it: though perhaps to <hi>ſleep</hi> (as old Father <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid) <hi>God may take you napping:</hi> though to <hi>oppoſe</hi> and <hi>deride</hi> the preacher, ſo did the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 2. 13. charge the Apoſtles as <hi>drunkards;</hi> yet of them three thouſand were <hi>added</hi> to the Church. The <hi>net</hi> of the Goſpel is ſpread, and thou mayſt be <hi>caught,</hi> though thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it not. As he that comes into the <hi>Sun,</hi> though he intends it not, may be <hi>warmed. Qui in unguentaria taberna reſederunt, &amp; paulò diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs commorati ſunt, odorem ſecum loci ferunt,</hi> ſayes <hi>Seneca:</hi> ſo while you ſtay out a Sermon, ſome ſavour of goodneſs may reſt upon you, though perhaps you intend nothing leſs: if thou comeſt for theſe ends, thou mayſt, though it is unlikely thou ſhouldeſt, profit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Worldly mindedneſs:</hi> This much hinders the profiting of the word of God. Our Saviour tells you this expreſſely in, the parable of the <hi>Sower,</hi> Mark 4. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: there is a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the world to draw our hearts from the word of God; and that three wayes.</p>
                     <p>I. As it <hi>alienates the affections of men from the word of God.</hi> They whoſe deſires run after, and whoſe love is fixed upon the world, muſt needs have the one dearer, the other cold to the word of God, <hi>You cannot,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Matth. 6. 24. The heart cannot be ſet upon both treaſures at once, no more then can one eye be lifted up to heaven, and the other caſt down upon the earth, at the ſame time. It was the <hi>farm,</hi> and <hi>oxen,</hi> that diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thoſe from the <hi>Supper,</hi> to which they were <hi>invited,</hi> Luk. 16. 14, and therefore the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Set your affections on things</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 3. 2.</note>

                        <hi>above, and not on things on the earth:</hi> you cannot do both together: and S. <hi>John, Love not the world, nor the things of the world; if any</hi>

                        <hi>one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> and if not the <hi>love of the Father,</hi> there is like to be little affection to the Word of God. Our Saviour expreſſes this, by <hi>ſowing among thorns,</hi> Matth. 13. 24. <hi>Wordly cares</hi> are <hi>thorns</hi> (as in many other, ſo eſpecially) in this reſpect; that as thorns eat out the heart of the earth, where the ſeed is ſown; ſo do the cares of the world the deſires of the ſoul towards the word of God; <hi>Nummus ill is magis reſonat, quàm ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>II. As it <hi>prejudices them againſt the word preached,</hi> that they ſhut their eares againſt it, and will by no means entertain it: the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compares the <hi>wicked</hi> to the <hi>deaf adder,</hi> Pſal. 58. 4, 5. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place tells us how the adder does it; <hi>allidet unam aurem terrae, &amp; de cauda obturat alteram:</hi> thus, when men have their hearts laid upon the world, it is no wonder, that they are <hi>deaf</hi> to the word of God: <hi>clauſas aures habent &amp; ſono aeris obtuſas,</hi> ſaies <hi>Ambroſe, the ſound of their riches, deafens them to the word of God.</hi> A worldly mans heart muſt needs be full of prejudices againſt the word, and the great doctrine of it, <hi>ſelf-denyal, taking up the croſs,</hi> and <hi>parting with all for Chriſt:</hi> upon hearing of theſe doctrines, they are ready to ſay, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can bear it.</hi> This was that which prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Jews againſt <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> preaching, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. that though they were convinced of the truth of it, and brought into a liking of it, yet they did not profit by it: becauſe <hi>their hearts went after their covetouſneſs.</hi> This prejudiced <hi>Demetrius</hi> and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 27. ſo thoſe againſt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> Acts 16. 19. The word of God does moſt hardly take place in a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous mans</hi> heart.</p>
                     <p>III. <hi>This worldly-mindedneſs oft makes Apostates from the word of God:</hi> the <hi>young man</hi> in the Goſpel heard Chriſt, and pretended an univerſal compliance to his commands, <hi>Matth</hi> 29. 21. but <hi>covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> lay at the bottome, and therefore, when Chriſt preſcribed his <hi>parting with all,</hi> he apoſtatizes from his former profeſſion. This made <hi>Demas</hi> leave <hi>Paul, 2 Tit.</hi> 4. 10 While mens hearts are ſet upon the world, and their thoughts wholly taken up with earthly things, they grow into a diſaffection of the word of God, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: and when any danger for the words ſake appears, they fall from it: yea, notwithſtanding that ſeeming joy and delight they entertain'd it with. This is moſt evident in the parable of the <hi>ſeed</hi> which fell on the <hi>ſtony</hi> ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. If therefore you would profit, when you come to hear the word, you muſt lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, not onely your <hi>worldly employments,</hi> but your <hi>earthly thoughts</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57001:79"/> and <hi>deſires,</hi> which otherwiſe will <hi>choke</hi> the word of God. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> went in obedience to the command of God to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> his ſon, he left his <hi>ſervants,</hi> and his <hi>Aſs</hi> behinde him, <hi>Geneſ. 22. 5. nè impediretur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paraeus,</hi> ſo ſhould we all our <hi>earthly thoughts</hi> and <hi>deſignes,</hi> when in obedience to the precept of God, we come to hear the word: that our hearts be emptied of theſe cares, <hi>nè intus existens,</hi> &amp;c. And we finde <hi>worldly-mindedneſs</hi> called by the Apoſtle <hi>the root of all evil, Tim.</hi> 6. 20. the root of this, amongſt the reſt, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs.</hi> Therefore it is obſerved, there were fewer <hi>Apoſtates</hi> in the Primitive times becauſe then there was little worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to tempt and ſolicite them from the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Neglect of prayer.</hi> I ſhewed you before the Miniſters engagement to pray for the people: in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 28. now I ſhall ſhew you the neglect of this duty in the people is a great cauſe of this unprofitableneſs. You are to pray therefore,</p>
                     <p>I. <hi>That God would open the Ministers mouth:</hi> this S. <hi>Paul</hi> oft puts thoſe upon, to whom he wrote, as the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> cap. 6. ver. 18, 19 and the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> cap. 4. ver. 2, 3. both for <hi>inward gifts,</hi> and <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp; the <hi>outward exerciſe</hi> of them: from which place we may note, 1. That there can be no profiting without a <hi>door of utterance:</hi> 2. That God muſt open it, as he did for <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was of <hi>ſlow ſpeech, Exod.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. ſo <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus.</hi> God is the onely teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of us to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and of you to <hi>profit:</hi> He muſt <hi>open</hi> our <hi>mouths</hi> and your <hi>hearts,</hi> as he did the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>word</hi> to both, before it can profit. So God ſaies in regard of the people <hi>Eſay.</hi> 48. 17. and ſo Chriſt promiſes to his miniſters <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 15. 3. Prayer is the <hi>key</hi> to open this <hi>door</hi> of <hi>utterance,</hi> to <hi>reveal</hi> the <hi>ſecret cabinet</hi> of Gods will and word: <hi>Knock, and it ſhall be opened</hi> is Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Matth</hi> 7. you muſt <hi>knock</hi> by <hi>prayer</hi> at the <hi>gate</hi> of heaven, that this <hi>door of utterance</hi> may be opened to the Miniſter: S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions this to his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 11.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>That God would open your hearts:</hi> God muſt do both, or neither will be done, <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. 14. S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for his <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 17, 18. and <hi>David</hi> for himſelf, <hi>Pſal. 119. 18. Cathedram habet in caelo qui corda docet,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> You may open your <hi>eares</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 16. de Doct. Chriſt.</note> to the word of God, and all the while your <hi>hearts</hi> may be ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, unleſs God open that. As our Saviour ſpake to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; <hi>Having eares hear you not?</hi> &amp;c. ſo it will be with every one, whoſe heart God doth not open: the Miniſter may bring the Word to the eare, but it is the ſpirit onely, can carry it effectually to the heart: <hi>Prov. 20. 12. The hearing eare, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> God muſt not onely give thee the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57001:79"/> word, but an eye to ſee it, and a heart to embrace it: as it is ſaid of Chriſts preaching to his two diſciples, <hi>Luc. 24. 45. Then opened he their underſtandings, that they might understand the Scriptures.</hi> The ſumme of it is, <hi>Prayer</hi> is the means to open the Miniſters mouth to ſpeak, and your hearts to entertain the word ſo, as to profit by it; and therefore neglect of this muſt needs cauſe unprofitableneſs. The <hi>Wiſeman</hi> directs you to this courſe, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It is the Lord onely that gives it, and if you would have it from him, you muſt crie after it: <hi>If any of you lack wiſdome, you muſt ask it of God,</hi> James 1. 5. How deeply are moſt men to be charged here? I accuſe none of you: but I wiſh you to deal faithfully with your ſelves. How ſeldome do you pray ſeriouſly to God, before you come here? Have you this morning been upon your knees, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly begging of God for the Miniſters, and your ſelves? if not, no wonder if you go away, as you come; charge it upon your ſelves (quarrel not with God, his Ordinances, or his Miniſters) as the cauſe of your unfruitfulneſs; if you come without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I do not wonder, that you go away without profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pride; when men come with proud hearts to the preaching of the word:</hi> they are more ready to ſcorn and oppoſe the word, then to profit by it.</p>
                     <p>This hinders,</p>
                     <p>I. <hi>Pride of our own righteouſneſs.</hi> When men are puffed up with a conceit of that, they diſcover not their want of the word of God, and ſo undervalue and ſleight it: this was the reaſon, why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours preaching wrought ſo little upon the Phariſees, as you may ſee <hi>John</hi> 39. 40. they were not <hi>convinced</hi> of their <hi>blindneſs</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> but lifted up with an opinion of their <hi>own holineſs:</hi> ſo it was with the Jews too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. If ever we intend to profit by the word, we muſt come emptied of our <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> and breathing after the righteouſneſs of Chriſt held forth in the Goſpel. An <hi>humble,</hi> though notorious ſinner will profit more at the word, then a <hi>proud</hi> ſelf-juſtitiarie: as the Publicans did at the preaching of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, more then the Phariſees.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>Pride of our own knowledge:</hi> this makes men think that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preaching of the word is needleſs: we ſhall hear nothing, but what we have heard before; we know it as well as the preacher can tell us: this is the pride of mens hearts. It was the <hi>Athenians</hi> pride of their <hi>Philoſophical notions,</hi> which made them eſteem <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching as a <hi>vain babling,</hi> Acts 17. As ſome proud ſcholars think themſelves beyond their Tutours reading: ſo many are too goodly to be taught. High <hi>Seraphical</hi> ſouls, that are lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57001:80"/> ordinances; that pretend to ſuch growth, that they can live without this ſpiritual food: there is <hi>pride of heart</hi> at the bottome of all. In heaven we ſhall live immediately upon God; but here mediately by his ordinances: there we ſhall ſee <hi>face to face,</hi> but here in the <hi>glaſs of the word:</hi> and if we deſire to profit by it, we muſt bring an humble frame of ſpirit. <hi>Jobs</hi> language would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us well, <hi>Job 34. 32. That which I ſee not, teach thou me:</hi> wait at wiſdomes gates for further diſcoveries, for here we know but in <hi>part,</hi> and ſee nothing but <hi>darkly:</hi> the beſt of us had need daily of eye-ſalve from Chriſt to have our <hi>eyes opened</hi> by the word: we<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> muſt become ſenſible of our ignorance, and in this become <hi>fools,</hi> that we may be <hi>wiſe:</hi> this pride muſt needs make the word unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table upon a three fold account.</p>
                     <p>1. It makes men <hi>untractable,</hi> and <hi>unteachable.</hi> A proud heart is apt to ſet up many carnal reaſonings, and proud imaginations, which exalt themſelves againſt the word: thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. whereby they quarrel with the truth of God, as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> when our Saviour preached to him of <hi>regeneration,</hi> he was as at his, <hi>How can this thing be? John</hi> 3. It was this pride made the Greeks count the Goſpel <hi>fooliſhneſs, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 23. This pride makes men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the word, and they think it a kinde of puſillanimitie of ſpirit to ſubmit to it: <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> ſaith proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. and thereupon rejects all his meſſages by <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſo thoſe proud<note place="margin">Jerem. 44. 16</note> Jews in <hi>Jeremiah. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaies, <hi>The word is not to be ſubmitted to the judgement of thoſe, who are not yet humbled, but have their minds pre-occupied and prejudiced by proud carnal reaſonings.</hi> Obſerve what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaies, <hi>Pſal. 10. 4. God is not in the thoughts of his heart.</hi> The proud will not ſeek after God, that is, in his ordinances; he thinks it needleſs, or elſe below him: the proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> were of all other men the moſt untractable of Chriſt's doctrine.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe pride makes men <hi>unwilling to hear what may moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi> A proud heart cannot endure to hear his <hi>particular</hi> ſins, his <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> corruptions ſtruck at, or diſcovered by the word of God. A <hi>particular</hi> reproof of ſin, is certainly the moſt <hi>profitable,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. and this a proud heart cannot endure. If Chriſt reproves the <hi>Phariſees</hi> hypocriſie, they are enraged againſt him, and plot his death. <hi>Herod</hi> muſt not endure to hear of his <hi>Herodias:</hi> ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 25. where it is ſaid, <hi>Ye ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof:</hi> theſe were <hi>proud ſcorners</hi> at the 22. <hi>verſe,</hi> and you may eaſily judge, how little like theſe are to profit. He is not like to have his wound <hi>healed,</hi> that cannot endure to have it <hi>ſearched.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:57001:80"/>
                     <p>3. Becauſe <hi>God will have nothing to do with ſuch in his Ordinances.</hi> He <hi>gives more grace to the humble, but reſiſts the proud,</hi> James 4. 6. God is his enemy. God, as I may ſay, every Sabbath keeps <hi>open houſes;</hi> every one may come, but, believe it, a <hi>proud</hi> heart is like to go away without his alms. <hi>He fills the hungry with good things, but ſends the rich emptie away,</hi> Luke 1. 53. and we finde at <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 5. that God ſpeaks <hi>comfort</hi> to ſuch as <hi>tremble at his word,</hi> not that <hi>ſcoff</hi> at it, and <hi>ſleight</hi> it, as a <hi>proud</hi> heart doth. God pours the oyl of grace and knowledge into emptie veſſels: and therefore, as you deſire to profit by the word preached, ſo labour for an humble frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It is ſaid by the <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> Prov. 11. 2. <hi>with the lowly is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> and to this end I ſhall ſuggeſt onely three notes.</p>
                     <p>I. This is the proper qualification of ſcholars in any ſcience. Nothing hinders knowledge more then pride: this was intimated in the poſture, which ſcholars amongſt the Jews were wont to uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſit at their Maſter's feet: ſo we finde it <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3. as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>humilitie.</hi> It is <hi>Philo's</hi> obſervation, that when the <hi>Eſſens</hi> came into the Synagogue, each ſcholar, according to their ſtanding, was wont to ſit at their Maſters feet: this expreſſion ſpeaks <hi>aptneſs</hi> to learn, and alſo a <hi>modeſt humility. Quòd ſi haec reverentia terrenis praeceptoribus debetur, quantò magis nos ad Christi pedes jacere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit, ut ex coeleſti ſolio loquenti dociles nos preſtemus,</hi> ſaies <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Calv. in locum</note> We read of <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 10. 39. that <hi>ſhe ſate at Jeſus feet and heard his word:</hi> upon which ſaies S. <hi>Auguſtine, Quantò humilior ad pedes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini ſedebat Maria, tantò ampliùs capiebat.</hi> We muſt caſt our ſelves at the feet of Chriſt in his Ordinances, if we will be his ſcholars. It is ſaid that the people <hi>ſtood at the feet of the mount,</hi> when the <hi>Law</hi> was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 17. ſo muſt we ſit at the feet of Chriſt, when the Goſpel is preached.</p>
                     <p>II. This <hi>humilitie</hi> will make us <hi>teachable</hi> by the word of God. An <hi>humble heart</hi> is like <hi>melted wax,</hi> which is fit to receive the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</hi> of the word of God, and willing to be moulded, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned according to it. An <hi>humble heart</hi> trembles at the <hi>threatnings,</hi> and ſo is like to profit. God will dwell with ſuch, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 2. It cloſes with the commands of it: as <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 33. <hi>We are all here preſent, to hear all that is commanded of God:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> tells us, that he <hi>will hear what God ſpeaks,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. It ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the reproofes of the word of God; it accounts of them as precious oyl: whereas a proud heart holds up againſt the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,<note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 5.</note> ſlights the commands, and rages againſt the reproofs of the word of God. That place of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jerem. 13. 15. is full and worth our obſervation. <hi>Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud: for the Lord hath ſpoken:</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57001:81"/> in your pride, you will never give an ear to the word of God.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p>III. To make all ſure, an <hi>humble heart</hi> ſhall have the Spirit of God for its teacher, and then ſuch ſhall be <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>profitably</hi> taught: <hi>the humble he will teach,</hi> Pſal. 25. 8, 9. it ſhall have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to <hi>lead into all truth, John</hi> 16. 13. The more <hi>humble,</hi> the more of the <hi>teachings</hi> of God. It is ſaid, that <hi>the Spirit deſcended upon Christ in the form of a dove:</hi> the <hi>dove</hi> is a meek creature, to teach us, that the diſcoveries of the Spirit are made to <hi>humble</hi> hearts.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The ſixth ground is <hi>carnal reaſonings,</hi> and <hi>prejudices</hi> in the hearts of men, which pre-poſſeſſing the ſoul, make the word ineffectual: which <hi>prejudices,</hi> while they remain, obſtruct the ſoul againſt the word of God: theſe are as ſo many bolts upon the doors of our hearts, that the word can get no entrance; theſe are naturally in every one of our hearts: and they are of two ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Againſt the <hi>word</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Againſt the <hi>preacher</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall diſcover and remove ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>I. Againſt the <hi>word</hi> it ſelf, which although it be admirable in it ſelf, and appointed for moſt excellent ends by God, yet are many <hi>prejudices</hi> againſt it in mens hearts: as</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>The meanneſs of this</hi> Ordinance, <hi>and ſeeming outward inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableneſs of ſome hours ſpeaking,</hi> which makes many to diſeſteem it: whence the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. becauſe moſt men are apt to judge it ſo. The ground of this <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> is mens <hi>non-attendance</hi> to the authoritie of God's inſtitution: as if a man ſhould conſider the <hi>matter,</hi> not the <hi>ſtamp</hi> of the coyn, which may make baſer mettals currant: we ſhould attend to Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> upon it, which makes it valuable; as the <hi>diamond</hi> in a ring makes the ring much more precious; and as the ſeal upon a ſcedule, which makes it effectual to the purpoſes contained in it: ſo is it the inſtitution of God, that makes this Ordinance ſo worthy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; and if we would profit by the word, we muſt remove this <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt the word for the <hi>means</hi> of it in it ſelf, and come to it, as Gods <hi>inſtitution,</hi> and in obedience to his command, and then are you like to thrive and profit by it. The Apoſtle gives you this, as an account of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> thriving under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: that they <hi>received the word, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. and this made it to <hi>work effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually</hi> in their hearts.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>pre-poſſeſsion of ſome politick opinion,</hi> it may be, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome <hi>great ones,</hi> and the ſtrain of the <hi>times;</hi> hence the word
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57001:81"/> of God finds no entrance: much truth is <hi>stifled</hi> upon this account, becauſe it will not comply with mens <hi>politick</hi> concernments, and the opinions they have taken up in compliance with their <hi>outward</hi> advantages; when truth comes to croſs theſe, then it is rejected. This is no new thing, it was ſo in our Saviours time amongſt the <hi>chief Rulers, John</hi> 12. 42. and with the <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, John</hi> 11. 48. and upon this account both Chriſt, and his doctrine was rejected; and hence it is ſaid, that <hi>the great ones received it not, John</hi> 7. 48. Thus many make truth to ſtoop and vail to politick deſigns; and this makes the word of God ineffectual. <hi>Ahab</hi> would not make reſtitution of <hi>Naboth's</hi> vineyard, becauſe it would not ſtand with his <hi>intereſt:</hi> thus doctrines do oft ebbe and flow upon politick conſiderations, and and the <hi>truth</hi> is loſt in the world.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>All is done by the Spirit, the Word is but a dead letter: may we not therefore better expect the whiſpers of it, then to be tyed to a conſtant attendance upon the word preached?</hi> As if the impotent people <hi>John</hi> 5. ſhould have argued, <hi>we cannot be healed unleſs we be put in, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will not lie at the pool:</hi> nay, they knew but one of them could be healed at a time, and yet all lay expecting. Is it in <hi>vain</hi> to <hi>ſow</hi> your ſeed, becauſe you can have no <hi>crop</hi> without the <hi>influence</hi> of heaven? ſo no <hi>ſowing</hi> the ſeed of the word, becauſe no <hi>thriving</hi> without the Spirit? It is ſaid, <hi>James 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us of the word of truth.</hi> The word is Gods, yet we are begotten by the word. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells his <hi>Corinthians, In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. Becauſe the hand writes, is the pen therefore needleſs? The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were S. <hi>Pauls epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> written by the finger of the Spirit, and Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching too, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 3. The Sun <hi>enlightens,</hi> but by a <hi>medium:</hi> the Spirit <hi>begets</hi> and <hi>regenerates,</hi> but by the <hi>word:</hi> as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>I have alreadie profited by the word, and therefore I have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need of it. The Apoſtle commands indeed, that we ſhould attend upon the preaching of the word, but no longer, then till the day ſtar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in our hearts,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. <hi>and I finde that alreadie in thoſe appearances of Chriſt to my ſoul, and theſe ſpiritual illuminations I have communicated unto me, therefore I am diſobliged from any further attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the word.</hi> In the removing of this ſcruple, I deſire theſe particulars may be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>I. Thy <hi>former experience</hi> of the efficiencie and power of the word will, if they have been true, <hi>ſweeten</hi> the word more to thee, <hi>raiſe up</hi> thy eſteem of it, <hi>revive</hi> thy delight in it, and <hi>engage</hi> thee in a further, and more <hi>chearfull</hi> attendance upon it. I beſeech you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57001:82"/> that pregnant place of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2, 3. As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby. If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> A <hi>true</hi> taſte will <hi>ſharpen</hi> our appetites, as a childe that hath taſted the <hi>breast,</hi> is ſtill longing and crying after it, and can hardly be <hi>weaned</hi> from it: ſo it will be with every true childe of God, who hath <hi>relliſhed</hi> this <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk</hi> of the word: he gets a ſtomach by eating. Indeed a man may have a <hi>light, ſuperficial</hi> taſte of the word, and apoſtatize, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. and that is ſad: but a <hi>real</hi> experience of the power and ſweetneſs of it moſt effectually quickens deſires after it. So it did in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63. 1, 2. He had <hi>ſeen,</hi> and therefore <hi>deſires to ſee.</hi> As it fared with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 27. <hi>Mine eyes have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, becauſe I taſted a little of this honey:</hi> ſo it is with Chriſtians, who have taſted the ſweetneſs of the word, they are <hi>enlightned</hi> to ſee the excellencie, and deſirableneſs of it, which quickens their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after it: as in <hi>Pſal. 34. 8. taſte that you may ſee.</hi> It is the want of <hi>taſte</hi> and experience, which hinders men from the ſight of the excellencie and deſirableneſs of it. I ſhould ſuſpect that man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have profited by the word, who himſelf pretends ſo to have profited by the word, as to be juſtly exempted from any further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon it.</p>
                     <p>II. We will charitably ſuppoſe it to be true, <hi>that thou haſt been converted by the word preached:</hi> but art thou ſo perfect all on a ſuddain, that thou needeſt no <hi>furtherances</hi> and <hi>additions</hi> of further degrees? What? becauſe thou art <hi>born again,</hi> is therefore the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk</hi> needleſs, by which thou ſhouldeſt grow? <hi>Thou profeſſeſt the truth,</hi> well; but doeſt thou not need to be <hi>confirmed</hi> by the word preached? It was the Apoſtles work to <hi>confirm the ſouls of the diſciples,</hi> Acts 14. 22. and ſurely moſt needfull in theſe unſteadie, unſettled, wavering, and apoſtatizing times, when many who have <hi>profeſſed highly,</hi> have <hi>apoſtatized fouly. Be your knowledge true,</hi> it is but <hi>imperfect,</hi> for we know but <hi>in part,</hi> and therefore you ſtill need the word to be a <hi>light</hi> and a <hi>lamp</hi> to you: <hi>your affections ſanctified,</hi> but perhaps are <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>heavie,</hi> they need the word to quicken and enflame them, as Chriſt did his diſciples, <hi>Luke 24. 32. Thou art at the higheſt pitch of thy attainments:</hi> why? Chriſt hath given Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 12. or, <hi>if thy graces thrive and grow,</hi> ſtill thy <hi>comforts</hi> may be but weak and languiſhing; therefore, thou ſtill needeſt the word quicken and ſtrengthen them; for God creates the <hi>fruit of the lips, peace.</hi> They are not ſenſible of their <hi>imperfection</hi> ſure, who feel not the <hi>want</hi> of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> ſupply of the word of God. The meat of <hi>one day,</hi> will not ſerve you for a <hi>week:</hi> and ſurely you do not pray onely for bodily,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57001:82"/> but ſpiritual food, when you ſay, <hi>Lord give us this day our daily bread.</hi> The Iſraelites gathered their <hi>Manna</hi> in the wilderneſs <hi>daily,</hi> and not <hi>once for all;</hi> if laid up, it putrified: while we are in our pilgrimage, we muſt daily gather the <hi>Manna</hi> of the word of God to nouriſh us, till we come to our heavenly Canaan, and then we ſhall not need it. <hi>Naaman</hi> waſhed ſeven times in <hi>Jordan</hi> before his leproſie was cleanſed: ſome of the old leproſie of ſin cleaves to the beſt, and we muſt be <hi>continually</hi> waſhing in the waters of the <hi>ſanctuarie:</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 34.</p>
                     <p>III. As to the <hi>Scripture</hi> pleaded in <hi>Peter,</hi> it is neceſſary to obſerve,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> that the word <gap reason="foreign">

I am with you unto the end of the world.</hi> What, no longer? Yes, it will be their happineſs to enjoy him to eternity. So <hi>Matth. 22. 44. Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footſtool:</hi> But ſhall Chriſt ſit there no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Yes ſurely. So here, <hi>untill</hi> notes the <hi>end</hi> of the word, not the <hi>term</hi> of time for our attendance. We muſt attend <hi>ſo long,</hi> but it doth not ſay, <hi>then no longer uſe of it.</hi> The <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> uſe this place to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their neglect of the word; for by the <hi>day-ſtar,</hi> they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>extraordinary immediate revelations:</hi> ſo by the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57001:83"/> the words. <hi>Ego hanc caliginem, cujus Petrus meminit ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vitae ſtadium extendo, ac diem tunc demum nobis illucere interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, cùm facie ad faciem videbimus quod nunc cernimus per ſpeculum &amp; in aenigmate.</hi> It is true that the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> does <hi>ſhine</hi> in the Goſpel, and by that into our hearts; but in the greateſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> there is a <hi>mixture</hi> of ſome <hi>darkneſs.</hi> We are in the body but as in <hi>ergaſtulo,</hi> as in a <hi>priſon,</hi> though ſome light come in by the <hi>craneys,</hi> yet more darkneſs remains upon us. Then ſhall the day fully appear, when all <hi>clouds</hi> of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſcattered,</hi> and the full riſing of the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> be upon us. Here <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Nos tantundem abſumus à pleno die, quantum à perfectione fides noſtra abeſt:</hi> our <hi>light</hi> here is but <hi>dim,</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> but <hi>imperfect;</hi> therefore while we live in the world, we ſhall want the lamp of the word to guide us; without which we walk but in darkneſs. They <hi>live upon death it ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Clemens</hi> elegantly, <hi>and ſee no more then one wrapt up in thickeſt darkneſs of the moſt obſcure night.</hi> The full appearances of God are in heaven, here he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts himſelf by his word, and to expect other ways of diſcoverie is but to tempt God. <hi>Attend then to the word of propheſie till the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar ariſeth,</hi> that is, till you come to ſee God face to face, and then no uſe of <hi>Ordinances;</hi> in the interim attend upon it, as the ordinary inſtituted means of your ſpiritual proficiencie. Content your ſelves with this <hi>manna,</hi> while you are in the wilderneſs, and then you ſhall eat of the <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>honey</hi> of that heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> which is above.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>I enjoy God in my private retirements, and live immediately upon God; and is not this a happy anticipation of heaven?</hi> Yes, too happy for any one to enjoy on this ſide heaven. It was above the <hi>eſtate</hi> of man in <hi>innocency,</hi> to whom then there where <hi>means</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> appointed, as the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> which ſome aſſert as a <hi>means</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that immortality, in which he was created: but all agree about it, as a <hi>Sacramental ſign</hi> of that eternity, which he ſhould have enjoyed in happineſs upon performance of obedience, which God required. Our enjoyment of God here is in and by the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> we <hi>ſee the power &amp; glory of God in the Sanctuary,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 2. an immediate viſion is a reſerve for heaven. Here God is to be ſeen as <hi>revealed</hi> in the word, there we ſhall ſee him, as he <hi>is:</hi> here in a <hi>glaſs,</hi> there <hi>face to face:</hi> here enjoyed in <hi>prayer, hearing</hi> and other <hi>duties,</hi> which are our ſpirituall converſes with God, there in an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate viſion</hi> and <hi>fruition.</hi> And this I take to be the meaning of that expreſſion in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 28. That God may be All in All:</hi> when as it is ſaid ver. 24. that <hi>then cometh the end, when he ſhall have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the kingdome of God:</hi> viz. as to the manner of <hi>Adminiſtration</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:57001:83"/> by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word, and other <hi>Ordinances:</hi> then there ſhall be none of theſe, for that fruition of God immediately ſhall be in ſtead of them all.</p>
                     <p>6. And laſtly, <hi>I have attended long, many years upon the word preached, and I finde no profit: therefore it is in vain to attend any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> I confeſs the <hi>non-proficiency</hi> of ſo many under means is a great diſcouragement both to <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>people.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be diſcouraged upon this account as appears by Acts 18. comparing the 6, the 9, and 10. verſes together: and to the <hi>people,</hi> as if their fields ſhould <hi>yearly</hi> be <hi>ſown,</hi> &amp; yet remain <hi>barren,</hi> it would much diſcourage them to ſow them again: therefore give me leave to ſpeak a word or two to each.</p>
                     <p>I. To the <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Haſt thou preached long, and no profit appears in thy people? Firſt, <hi>mourn in ſecret</hi> for it: <hi>water</hi> the word with thy <hi>tears:</hi> thus did Chriſt over Jeruſalem, whom he had oft diſcovered himſelf to, and preached, Luk. 19. 41. Peter <hi>wept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> before he <hi>converted others.</hi> Secondly, <hi>pray much that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit:</hi> you may profit more <hi>pietate orationum quàm oratorum facultate,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> a <hi>praying</hi> Miniſter will profit more then an <hi>eloquent</hi> oratour. Thirdly, <hi>reform thy ſelf:</hi> perhaps thy ſin may hinder the efficacy of the word, and the ſeed may not <hi>thrive,</hi> becauſe thou ſoweſt it with a <hi>leprous</hi> hand. Obſerve what Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren:</hi> and when thou art converted thy ſelf, it is like that thou maieſt profit more by thy preaching. But, Fourthly, <hi>by no means give over:</hi> the peoples neglect of theirs, cannot exempt thee from thy duty. <hi>Wo be to me, if I preach not,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and whether the people will hear, or whether they will forbear, we muſt preach: for, 1. <hi>thy word may profit afterward,</hi> we muſt not limit God, but attend our duty: when <hi>Elias</hi> was ſo much <hi>diſcouraged,</hi> God had ſeven thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: ſo when <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>diſheartned,</hi> God encourages him with this, <hi>I have much people in this city,</hi> Acts 18. 10. It is an excellent ſaying of <hi>Seneca, An profecturus ſim neſcio: malo mihi ſucceſſum deeſſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>quàm fidem.</hi> It is better for us to be <hi>unſucceſſive,</hi> then <hi>diſobedient.</hi> It is not for us to know the times and ſeaſons, which God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The <hi>huſbandman</hi> ſowes his <hi>ſeed,</hi> though he can give himſelf no aſſurance of a <hi>crop:</hi> which <hi>Metaphor</hi> the Apoſtle leads us unto Jam. 5. 7. he does not ſow and reap both in a day. 2. <hi>The ſincerity of your obedience and endeavour will however be acceptable unto God,</hi> as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was in offering his ſon, though the event followed not, therefore in Gods account he did it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 17. God in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed, 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 12. which is a ſpecial ground of comfort to Chriſtians in every calling and employment. But, 3. thy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57001:84"/> 
                        <hi>reward ſhall be ſecured,</hi> Eſay. 49. 5. God rewards not onely our ſucceſs, but our faithfulneſs. S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>hold forth the word of life, that he might rejoyce in the day of Chriſt, that he might not ſeem to have run in vain, nor laboured in vain:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Miniſters of the Goſpel may ſeem to labour in vain, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>efficacy</hi> of their Miniſtery, but certainly it ſhall not be in reſpect of the <hi>reward</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>II. To the <hi>people.</hi> It is ſerious matter of lamentation, that the Miniſters ſhould have occaſion to complain with the Prophet, <hi>Eſay 8. 18. Behold, I and the children, whom the Lord hath given me, are for ſigns and wonders in Iſrael;</hi> that is, becauſe they were ſo few and rare: and that they ſhould have occaſion to complain with the ſame Prophet, <hi>Eſa. 53. Who hath believed our report?</hi> And it is ſad for you, <hi>Brethren,</hi> if it be any of your caſe: if it be, <hi>mourn</hi> over it, and <hi>pray</hi> againſt it, as the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 18. <hi>Open mine eyes that I may ſee into the wonders of thy Law:</hi> and withall obſerve with me;</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>God doth not expect equal proficiency from all:</hi> as a <hi>Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Tutour</hi> doth not of all <hi>ſcholars,</hi> whom yet he may approve and commend for their diligence. This I ſpeak for the <hi>comfort</hi> of thoſe Chriſtians, who are the moſt conſcientious <hi>waiters</hi> on the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> yet complain they profit not anſwerably. The <hi>good</hi> ground in Matth. 13. 23. did not bring forth equally, but ſome <hi>thirty,</hi> ſome <hi>ſixty,</hi> and ſome an <hi>hundred: fruitfull</hi> fields bring forth <hi>unequal</hi> crops; ſo it is poſſible, that among thoſe who conſcionably attend on the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> ſome may profit more then others.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Thy proficiencie may not appear preſently:</hi> as oft we are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of our fields, yet afterwards receive a good crop. In the night of temptation, or the like, the word may be obſcured, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but may afterward ſhew it ſelf to the comfort of thy ſelf, and rejoycing of others.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Perhaps thou profiteſt more in thy actions, then thy knowledge.</hi> They are not alwayes the beſt proficients in the word, who declare moſt, and know beſt; if thy affections be enflamed towards the word, and thou beeſt carefully conſcientious to practiſe ſuitably to thy knowledge, thou haſt profited more then your <hi>notional high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown profeſſours,</hi> which yet are <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>careleſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Be still conſtant in thy attendance upon the word.</hi> This is thy <hi>ſeed-time,</hi> therefore practiſe the <hi>Wiſemans</hi> advice, which he gives, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 6.

                     <p>I. Againſt his <hi>Perſon.</hi> We are offended at the <hi>meanneſs</hi> of it, he is a man <hi>like our ſelves,</hi> or elſe we are diſ-affected to him, and both theſe cauſe unprofitableneſs under the word preached, as it did in our Saviours auditours, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 55, 57. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the <hi>perſon</hi> of Chriſt, and ſo rejected his <hi>doctrine. Ahab</hi> hates <hi>Micaiah,</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, and therefore refuſed to enquire of him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 8. This ſinfull reſpect of perſons, hinders the efficacie of the word, as it oft begets diſ-affections in the heart of people towards the ableſt <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Theſe come not to hear the <hi>word,</hi> but the <hi>man:</hi> till you eſteem the <hi>perſon,</hi> you will hardly profit by his <hi>doctrine.</hi> I plead not for a ſuperſtitious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their perſons; but as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 13. I deſire that they may be <hi>esteemed very highly for their works ſake.</hi> Theſe <hi>prejudices</hi> are oft times cauſeleſs, ariſing from our own corruptions, either becauſe we are too apt to <hi>entertain reports</hi> againſt them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles rule, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. or elſe <hi>affectation of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> diſ-affects us to them; or <hi>want of charity</hi> to cover their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but pry into their <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>failings,</hi> though they be but the <hi>ſpots</hi> of Gods children. This is moſt irrational, if we did but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, that the efficacie of the word depends not upon the Miniſter. <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. converted more, then Chriſt did in all his time for ought we read. We ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect the <hi>meſſage</hi> for the <hi>meſſenger,</hi> but rather eſteem the <hi>meſſenger</hi> for the <hi>meſſage</hi> ſake: we ſhould minde the <hi>pearl</hi> that is brought us, more then the <hi>hand</hi> that brings it.</p>
                     <p>II. Againſt his <hi>gifts: I would hear him, but his gifts are mean and ſmall.</hi> I could heartily wiſh, that there were not too great

                     <p>1. <hi>Variety of gifts are for your good and advantage,</hi> as the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. whether clegant <hi>Apollos,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſolid <hi>Cephas;</hi> all are for your good. Obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently that full and pregnant place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from ver. 7. to ver. 12. One interprets <hi>ſolidly,</hi> another reaſons <hi>profoundly,</hi> a third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>powerfully,</hi> a fourth wins <hi>affectionately,</hi> and another demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates <hi>cunningly,</hi> and all to thy <hi>profit.</hi> There are two things ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted which may help to unprejudice us in this particular: 1. the <hi>freedome of the Spirit,</hi> in diſtributing theſe gifts, at verſ. 11. and therefore we muſt not quarrel with the wiſdome of God in it. 2. the <hi>end,</hi> for which God hath deſigned this variety, viz. our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> at verſ. 7. there are not the <hi>meaneſt</hi> gifts, but an <hi>humble ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> Chriſtian may make uſe of, and profit by.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>This prejudice reflects diſhouourably upon God, and takes his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and gives it to the inſtruments.</hi> God will have the glory of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to be magnified; and therefore ſometimes uſes the <hi>meaneſt</hi> gifts to the <hi>greatest</hi> ends. As this advanced his glory at the firſt, that the Goſpel ſhould be propounded by ſuch <hi>inconſiderable</hi> perſons, as a few <hi>fiſher-men.</hi> God conſulted his <hi>glory,</hi> when he put this heavenly treaſure in <hi>earthen</hi> veſſels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Look not on <hi>glittering</hi> of the <hi>ſword,</hi> but to the hand that <hi>weilds</hi> it: look up from men to God, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake to the men of Iſrael, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 12. concerning the cure wrought upon the lame man: <hi>Why gaze ye on us, it was not we but God.</hi> God often uſes feeble inſtruments, that himſelf may have the <hi>greater</hi> glory; and layes aſide great parts, when men begin to glory too much in them. The ſame truth is<note place="margin">John 3. 8.</note> preached by all, and the <hi>Spirit bloweth where he liſteth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Perhaps he denies his abilities for thy good.</hi> He could be <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall,</hi> and in the <hi>clouds,</hi> but he <hi>ſtoops</hi> and <hi>deſcends</hi> to thy <hi>capacity;</hi> and <hi>denies</hi> himſelf, that he may <hi>gain</hi> thee. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>third heaven,</hi> and could ſpeak with <hi>tongues more then all, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 18. and yet deſired to <hi>ſpeak rather to edification.</hi> Judge <hi>charitably;</hi> it is likely the Miniſter denyes his excellency, as deſirous that thou ſhouldſt be brought in love with the <hi>naked</hi> truth of the Goſpel, and not with the <hi>dreſſe</hi> it comes in, that the Goſpel may come by its own power and efficacy upon thy ſoul, therefore he ſtudies a <hi>familiar plainneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. <hi>The abler thy Preacher is, if thou profit not ſo much the more by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57001:85"/> him, the greater will be thy condemnation.</hi> Satisfie not thy ſelf therefore with this, that thou <hi>liveſt</hi> under <hi>an able Miniſter</hi> (men may affect this more for their credit, then aiming thereby atttheir profit) nor let this exalt thee in <hi>contempt</hi> of others, thy account will be the <hi>greater;</hi> and if thou profiteſt not ſo much the more, very ſad. How ſad will it be for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had Chriſt preaching amongſt them, yet <hi>refuſed</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> him: and thoſe, againſt whom the Apoſtles <hi>ſhaked</hi> of the <hi>duſt</hi> of their <hi>feet,</hi> for the not-entertaining of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: and for you, <hi>Brethren,</hi> who enjoy as much of Goſpel-light as ever appeared upon the world, if you ſhall be found <hi>unprofitable</hi> at that day, when many, who have lived under leſs means, ſhall be found improved ſuitable to the means they lived under, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>rewarded,</hi> and you, who have been under the <hi>richeſt dews</hi> of heaven, be found <hi>unfruitfull,</hi> you ſhall be diſpatched with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi> ſervant, <hi>Matth. 25. 30. Take you, and cast the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs, there ſhal be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Away then with theſe <hi>prejudices,</hi> which muſt needs make the word unprofitable: while one quarrels with the <hi>method,</hi> another with the <hi>expreſsion,</hi> a third with the <hi>matter,</hi> a fourth with the <hi>delivery,</hi> the word is like to profit little.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The ſeventh ground is <hi>hardneſs of heart.</hi> That <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> hardneſs, which is in every one of us, much hinders the working of the word of God in us: that heart of ſtone reſiſts the divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the word; and therefore, God when he promiſes to write his <hi>Law in our hearts,</hi> he firſt promiſes to take away <hi>this heart of ſtone,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27. One thing in the ſtonie heart is <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trableneſs,</hi> and this makes men <hi>threatning-proof,</hi> and <hi>judgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof:</hi> they <hi>tremble</hi> not at the one, nor are <hi>broken</hi> by the other. And this eſpecially, when the ſoul comes to be <hi>hardned</hi> by cuſtome in ſin: the <hi>ſeed,</hi> you know, which fell on this ground, <hi>periſhed.</hi> Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſlighted all <hi>Moſes's</hi> meſſages, and remains hard under varietie of Gods judgements, both <hi>threatned</hi> and <hi>inflicted.</hi> Obſerve the exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 3. 13. To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>If once your heart be hardned, it will be to little purpoſe to exhort.</hi> A <hi>hard</hi> heart may be moved by the word of God, but ſtill remain, and afterward meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of God, but ſtill remain, and afterward grow more obdurate. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is a ſad example, whom every meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of God <hi>hardned</hi> more. As <hi>rain</hi> may <hi>wet</hi> a <hi>ſtone</hi> outwardly, but ſtill it retains it's innate hardneſs; ſo it is poſſible, a hard <hi>heart</hi> may ſeem outwardly to melt into ſome tears, the effect, perhaps, of a mans natural temper and conſtitution, yet remain hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken: as it was with thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>Jerem. 5. 3. Thou haſt ſmitten them, yet they have not grieved,</hi> &amp;c. Notwithſtanding the

The <hi>hard</hi> earth muſt be broken up, e're your ſeed will thrive in it: ſo muſt the <hi>hard</hi> heart, that the ſeed of Gods word may take <hi>rooting</hi> in it. The word is the inſtrument of the Spirit to break up the heart; and therefore compared to a <hi>hammer</hi> that <hi>breaks the rock in pieces,</hi> Jerem. 23. 29. and till this be done, there can be no profiting by the word. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was of a tender heart, and ſo <hi>melted</hi> at the word of God, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. ſo muſt all be, who intend ſavingly to profit by the <hi>word.</hi> There is indeed a <hi>hardneſs</hi> of heart, which excludes all poſſibilitie of <hi>profiting</hi> by the <hi>word:</hi> I mean, when God ſeals up men <hi>judicially</hi> under unprofitableneſs for their former <hi>reſiſting</hi> and <hi>oppoſing</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of God. Of which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that place, <hi>John 12. 40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they ſhould not ſee,</hi> &amp;c. This was <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> caſe, when he had hardned himſelf, God at laſt hardned him ſo, that he refuſed the meſſages of God to him by <hi>Moſes,</hi> till he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruined; when mens conſciences, as the Apoſtle ſaith, are <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized and ſeared;</hi> they grow <hi>inſenſible</hi> under the <hi>word of God,</hi> and the <hi>ſhinings of the Goſpel,</hi> (as the <hi>Sun</hi> the <hi>clay</hi>) more hardens them: as it fared with the <hi>Jews,</hi> Ezek. 2. 4. for all his oft ſpeaking unto them, <hi>they were impudent,</hi> or, as it is in the margin, <hi>Hard of face.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eighthly, The eighth ground is <hi>unbelief.</hi> This the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns in the Text, as the cauſe of the <hi>Jews unprofitableneſs,</hi> becauſe it was not <hi>mixed with faith,</hi> and truely this muſt needs cauſe <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs,</hi> both becauſe we cannot draw near to God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances without this. <hi>Unbelief</hi> is a <hi>departing from God. We may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our bodies indeed before God, yet without faith can we not digeſt the word of God into ſpiritual nouriſhment,</hi> as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaies.</p>
                     <p>There is required of us,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>An hiſtorical faith,</hi> whereby we believe the <hi>word</hi> of God to be the <hi>word</hi> of God, and <hi>cloſe</hi> with the truth of it in our aſſent and judgement. The underſtanding is the <hi>leading facultie</hi> of the ſoul, and the <hi>guide of reaſon;</hi> I ſhall never cloſe with that truth in my <hi>affections</hi> to <hi>love</hi> it, in my <hi>will</hi> to <hi>practiſe</hi> it, which I do not firſt <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57001:86"/> unto</hi> in my <hi>underſtanding:</hi> nor can the <hi>will</hi> embrace that as good, which the <hi>underſtanding</hi> aſſents not to as true. But this is not enough; for there is required further,</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>A particular applying faith,</hi> whereby the ſoul cloſeth with the <hi>word,</hi> as <hi>proper</hi> to it ſelf: when it particularly applies the <hi>promiſes,</hi> and cloſes with the <hi>reproofs</hi> and <hi>threatnings</hi> of the <hi>word.</hi> This makes the <hi>word</hi> of God to be ineffectual, becauſe men ſhift it off from themſelves; as, <hi>ſuch a reproof of ſin concern'd not me: the Minister reproved ſuch an one,</hi> &amp;c. A man may aſſent to the truth of a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and yet it be a <hi>dry-breast</hi> to him without the <hi>application</hi> of it by a <hi>particular</hi> faith: ſo to the truth of a <hi>threatning,</hi> and yet not be humbled. <hi>Faith</hi> is neceſſarie to the hearing of the <hi>word</hi> profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.</p>
                     <p>I. <hi>As the eye of faith diſcerns the truth of the word, as it pries into the mysteries of the Goſpel, which the natural man perceives not.</hi> The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. gives a reaſon why a natural man cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe; <hi>becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> and ſo no object ſuitable to a carnal eye. It is ſaid of Chriſts entertainment, <hi>John 1. 5. The darkneſs comprehendeth not the light:</hi> every <hi>unbeliever</hi> is no better then <hi>mere darkneſs,</hi> though improved with the height of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired knowledge; as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are very pregnant proofs of this: and I appeal to your ſelves; <hi>Are men like to profit by the word they perceive not, nor underſtand?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. <hi>As it makes the ſoul to reliſh, and delight in the word of God.</hi> To an unbeliever, the great <hi>myſteries</hi> of the Goſpel are but <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24. <hi>The carnal minde is not ſubject to the law of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. A <hi>carnal</hi> minde may approve of the word of God, as true and good, but never cloſe with it throughly and heartily, becauſe it is contrarie to it. As a learned man may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the light, as excellent in it ſelf, but will not endure to look long upon it, becauſe it may be hurtfull to his weak eyes: thus a <hi>carnal</hi> heart may aſſent to the truth of Gods word, and be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the equitie and goodneſs of it, yet not cloſe with it, becauſe contrarie to his <hi>carnal intereſts,</hi> and <hi>corrupt principles;</hi> and ſo long no profiting by it. As S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quid haec duo conferunt</hi>

                     <p>Ninethly, The nineth ground is <hi>love of ſome darling and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſin and corruption.</hi> The Apoſtle indeed, <hi>James</hi> 1. 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to <hi>lay aſide all ſuperfluitie of naughtineſs;</hi> but eſpecially any <hi>darling</hi> ſin, which elſe will make the word unprofitable upon a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account.</p>

And therefore you ſhall obſerve, that ſome, who have ſeemingly made large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the profeſſion of the word, have been wholly offended at it, when it hath ſearched, and diſturb their ſecret <hi>boſome</hi> corruption.

                        </gap>, <hi>from his youth,</hi> Mark 10. 20. till it came to his <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt prove ineffectual, and he goes away <hi>ſorrowfully.</hi> While a man retains the love of any <hi>darling</hi> ſin, he is apt to come with a <hi>ſettled</hi> reſolution, let the Preacher ſay what he will, ſhew him the nature, danger, and guilt of ſuch or ſuch a ſin, to go on ſtill, as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25.</p>
                     <p>II. <hi>As it diſaffects them to the preacher.</hi> That did diſaffect the Phariſees ſo much againſt Chriſt, his <hi>reproving</hi> their <hi>darling</hi> ſin of <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi> This cauſed <hi>Felix</hi> to diſmiſs <hi>Paul,</hi> his <hi>touching</hi> upon his darling ſin of <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>injuſtice.</hi> And hence proceeds the <hi>ebbings</hi> and <hi>flowings</hi> of mens affections to the ſame Miniſter. You ſhall have ſome, who will conſtantly attend upon a Miniſter, and afford him a very fair aprobation, till he come powerfully to ſearch his boſome corruption, then he is offended, nay, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps perſecutes the Miniſter too. Thus it fared with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,: one while they crie, <hi>never man ſpake like him,</hi> and another while, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> See the <hi>Galatians</hi> inconſtancie to S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 14, 15, 16. they afforded him both <hi>reverence,</hi> verſe 14. and <hi>love,</hi> verſe 15. <hi>rari amoris indicium, oculos eruere plus est, quàm vitam profundere,</hi> ſaies <hi>Calvin:</hi> but how ſoon is this <hi>love</hi> degenerated into <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>enmitie,</hi> verſe 16. and that onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>told them the truth.

                     <p>Tenthly, The tenth ground is <hi>unpreparedneſs,</hi> when men ruſh out of their worldly employments without <hi>prayer</hi> or <hi>meditation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God, never conſidering either into whoſe <hi>preſence,</hi>

I will waſh mine hands in innocencie, ſo will I compaſs thine altar.</hi> Thus when <hi>Jacob</hi> went to worſhip God at <hi>Bethel,</hi> he purged his houſe of all the Idols, and made his ſons to <hi>waſh their clothes,</hi> Gen. 35. 2, 3.

So ſhould we come with that <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>preparedneſs,</hi> as becomes the preſence of God.</p>

                     <p>Eleventhly, The eleventh ground is <hi>Curioſity:</hi> when men come to the Word, affecting more the <hi>elegancy</hi> of the <hi>expreſſion,</hi> then the <hi>wholeſomeneſs</hi> of the <hi>truth. Cui nullus in dicendo ſermo placet niſi Grammaticè fuerit conceptus, Dialecticè imaginatus, Rhetoricè purpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſes it. Such like not their ſpiritual food unleſs it be adorned with the <hi>flowers</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> who regard more how <hi>handſome</hi> the proviſion be, than how wholeſome. Hence <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> many times <hi>handſomely dreſſed</hi> findes more entertainment, then a <hi>plain truth.</hi> So men take <hi>poyſon</hi> inſtead of <hi>nouriſhment:</hi> thus when men catch more at an <hi>elegancy</hi> in a Sermon, then a <hi>promiſe;</hi> they may be <hi>pleaſed</hi> perhaps, but little <hi>profited.</hi> In <hi>ſeed</hi> you look not at <hi>leaves,</hi> as you doe in <hi>flowers;</hi> but at the <hi>inward vertue,</hi> whereby it hath an aptitude to fructifie: ſo ſhould we in the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the word, not prize the outward <hi>ſeeming dreſs</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of it ſo much, as the <hi>inward efficacy</hi> of it, whereby it may <hi>fructifie</hi> in your hearts and lives. <hi>Qui maturitatis fructum quaerit, deſpicit amaena camporum,</hi> ſaies <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chryſolog. ſerm.</hi> 18.</note> He that deſires <hi>profit</hi> from a field, lookes to the <hi>ripeneſs</hi> of the <hi>corn,</hi> not to the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>cockle,</hi> which may more gratifie the <hi>eye</hi> but not fill the <hi>barn</hi> and <hi>granary:</hi> ſo he that deſires to profit by the word, muſt not attend the <hi>adorning</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more <hi>pleaſe</hi> the <hi>fancy,</hi> but not at all <hi>relliſh</hi> the <hi>ſoul,</hi> ſuch may more gratify the <hi>palate,</hi> but it is not ſo good for <hi>nouriſhment.</hi> The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>elegancy</hi> of a Sermon may more gratify <hi>curioſity,</hi> but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and nouriſh the <hi>ſoul.</hi> It is true that S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obſerves, that <hi>propter faſtidia plurimorum, etiam ea, ſine quibus vivere non poſſumus, alimenta condienda ſunt.</hi> But they live miſerablely that live altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon <hi>ſauces.</hi> There is another curioſity, much like this, which makes the word unprofitable, and that is a <hi>nice ſquemiſhneſs,</hi> that men <hi>nauſeate</hi> truth, that they have heard of before; as an ill <hi>ſqueaſy</hi> ſtomach, which cannot make <hi>two meales</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> meat: whereas, we had need, conſidering our <hi>dulneſs</hi> to underſtand, our <hi>forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of what we have heard, to have the <hi>ſame</hi> truths preached over and over again, and yet ſhall we finde all little enough. We may ſee what was the temper of thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 42. they beſought the Apoſtles, that the <hi>ſame words might be taught again the next Sabbath:</hi> this I ſpeak, not to <hi>patronize</hi> lazineſs in the preacher, but to <hi>correct</hi> the curioſity of the hearer; which makes the word become ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to them.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, The twelfth ground is, <hi>Not attending upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſettled ministery.</hi> This is that which God hath uſed from the firſt planting of Churches for the edification of his people, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and confirmed by the practiſe of the whole primitive Church. <hi>Trees</hi> oft <hi>tranſplanted</hi> can take no firm
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57001:88"/> rooting: a <hi>rolling ſtone,</hi> we ſay, <hi>gathers no moſs:</hi> thoſe, whoſe fickle unſettledneſs prompts them to run from this Miniſter to that, and to ſettle under none, are like to profit very little by the word. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves ſharply in his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 12, 13. He walkes ſecurely, that is guided by ſome <hi>fixed ſtar,</hi> whiles he who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſome <hi>meteor</hi> is led into ſome bog or pit: ſo thoſe, who walk by the light of ſome <hi>ſettled Miniſter</hi> as a <hi>ſtar fixed</hi> to his <hi>orb,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſafe in the way of Religion, but thoſe who follow <hi>wandring meteors</hi> fall into ſome pit of errour. Many thrive and live health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on <hi>one diſh,</hi> while others ſurfeit of <hi>variety.</hi> By attending upon a <hi>ſettled Miniſter,</hi> you come to be acquainted with his <hi>ſtyle,</hi> familiar with his <hi>phraſe,</hi> and learn his <hi>method;</hi> which will facilitate, and ſtrengthen memory, that you may carry away, and profit more by him.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, The thirteenth ground is <hi>want of love to the word of God.</hi> Men come out of <hi>cuſtome,</hi> and not out of a <hi>real ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>want</hi> of the word, or with any love unto it. If men had ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the word, as <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf that he had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 20. that his ſoul did even <hi>break for the longings</hi> he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods word, much more would they profit by it. If with <hi>Job</hi> they <hi>prized</hi> it more then <hi>their ordinary food,</hi> Job 23. 12. A man that ſits down to his meals, when he hath no liking to the meat ſet before him, he will not nouriſh <hi>kindly</hi> by it, neither will any nouriſh <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> that brings not a good affection to the word of God.</p>
                     <p>I. It is ſo in all <hi>other</hi> knowledge: you may perhaps have it by experience. If you put your children to a <hi>trade</hi> which they do not deſire or love, they will ſcarcely prove <hi>artiſts</hi> in it; ſo if men put their children out, intending to make them <hi>ſcholars;</hi> if they do not love their books, they will prove but <hi>dunces;</hi> and therefore many parents do wiſely diſpoſe of their children, according to their <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>inclinations:</hi> ſo if men love not the word of God, they are not probable to make any great <hi>proficiency</hi> in it. <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning affection;</hi> what I <hi>love,</hi> I am ready to take <hi>pains</hi> for, and not to endure to be without it. Thus if men did <hi>love</hi> the word, they would take <hi>pains</hi> for it, <hi>familiarize</hi> it to them by much reading, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hearing, ſerious meditation, and not endure to be without it. Let <hi>David</hi> be an example; <hi>Oh, how do I love thy Law!</hi> and this puts upon <hi>meditating</hi> upon the law <hi>day and night:</hi> and when he was without it, he <hi>mourns</hi> for it, and ſayes, <hi>One day in Gods courts is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a thouſand elſwhere;</hi> and he cannot <hi>reflect</hi> upon his former enjoyment of that word without a <hi>tear,</hi> Pſal. 42. 4. The Apoſtle is very full and pertinent to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:</hi> as a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57001:89"/> childe finds <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> in nothing but the <hi>breaſt:</hi> ſo that it cries if it be without it; and thus if we affect the word, we ſhall thrive by it.</p>
                     <p>II. This provokes God to proceed <hi>judicially,</hi> to give men up to unprofitableneſs, and while they like not the <hi>truth,</hi> to give them up to <hi>errour.</hi> The Apoſtle is expreſs in this, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. And here we ſee that <hi>notional</hi> profeſſours, who have got a <hi>notion</hi> of truth in their <hi>heads,</hi> but not the <hi>love</hi> of truth in their <hi>hearts,</hi> oft turn <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> and <hi>back-ſliders,</hi> as theſe times give us ſad experience of. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> began to loath <hi>manna,</hi> God gave them <hi>quails</hi> indeed, but his <hi>wrath</hi> with them, Numb. 11. 33. and <hi>leanneſs into their ſouls,</hi> Pſal. 106. 15. So when men love not the <hi>manna</hi> of the word, &amp;c. <hi>Love</hi> of the truth puts men upon a <hi>conſtant attendance</hi> upon the word, as the means of grace and knowledge: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they are like to profit by it: ſo it is ſaid of the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they were <hi>exemplary believers, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7. and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof is given, verſ. 6. becauſe <hi>they received the word with much joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, The fourteenth ground is <hi>a reſting in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> in the <hi>opus operatum, the work done;</hi> and ſo look no further. And this men are very apt to do, as <hi>Micah</hi> bleſſes himſelf, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 13. becauſe he had gotten a <hi>Levite</hi> into his houſe: ſo many conclude the <hi>love of God,</hi> and their <hi>own ſecurity,</hi> barely upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a <hi>miniſtery</hi> and <hi>preaching.</hi> So did thoſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. They cry out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord:</hi> and ſo many alſo of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>We enjoy that, and therefore all is well.</hi> You may finde ſome making plea of this unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke 13. 26. Thou haſt taught in our ſtreets;</hi> but Chriſt diſmiſſes them for all that, with a <hi>neſcio; I know you not,</hi> verſ. 27. Thus did the Jews of old, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17. they <hi>reſted in the law,</hi> and <hi>made their boaſt of God:</hi> and ſo do Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, they think that they have done God ſervice abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they have heard two ſermons on the Sabbath-day, and never look to their proficiency. As many an idle ſcholar ſatisfies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he hath been at his Tutours lecture, though he cares not to profit by it. If you reſt onely in this, it may be ſo far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting you, that it may be your ruine. Chriſt at the laſt-day will acquit none for enjoying the Goſpel, but condemn them for not profiting by it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, The fifteenth ground is <hi>Unfaithfulneſs of memory, and forgetfulneſs, when the word goes in at one ear, and out at another.</hi> When this <hi>ſpiritual food</hi> ſtayes not with us, it is not like to <hi>nouriſh</hi> us. The word muſt be <hi>treaſured</hi> up in the <hi>memory,</hi> before it can <hi>fructifie</hi> in our <hi>hearts.</hi> It is not the <hi>forgetful hearer</hi> that is <hi>bleſſed,</hi> Jam. 1. 25. ſuch an one is like a man who looks his <hi>face</hi> in a <hi>glaſs,</hi> and preſently
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57001:89"/> forgets; ſo ſuch an one takes a <hi>glance</hi> at the word, and the word is out of his memory, aſſoon as himſelf is out of the Church. If you would profit by the word, you muſt practiſe the Apoſtles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Let nothing ſlip:</hi> a Metaphor from a <hi>ſieve</hi> or <hi>leaking veſſel,</hi> when the liquour runs out as faſt as it is put in. But becauſe want of memory is a great complaint among many, and ſome of them, out of queſtion, <hi>ſerious</hi> Chriſtians, I ſhall give theſe brief directions.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Pray for the Spirit:</hi> one office of whom is to be a <hi>remembrancer,</hi> John 14. 26.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Meditate in private upon the word of God.</hi> Men goe out of the church preſently to their <hi>worldly employment,</hi> and give liberty to their <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> and <hi>idle diſcourſes,</hi> and ſo the word is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Confer with others about the truths thou heareſt.</hi> This <hi>conference</hi> will both <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> memory, and <hi>fasten</hi> truths in it, and alſo <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>enflame</hi> affections to it; as coales lying together kindle each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: thus did the <hi>diſciples,</hi> Luc. 24. 14. Rather then forget a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable truth conſult the miniſter: it is needleſs <hi>modeſty</hi> in thee, if thou enquire not, and <hi>pride</hi> in him, if he does not enforme thee.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Get your affections raiſed and enflamed to truth.</hi> If men loved the word of God, they would remember it more: did you ever know a <hi>covetous miſer</hi> forget where his bags were laid: if we could eſteem the word as our <hi>treaſures,</hi> and <hi>greater treaſures</hi> then thoſe <hi>of Gold</hi> we ſhould remember more of it.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Perhaps, what thou remembreſt (though but little) keeps thee to cloſe walking with God.</hi> Be not diſcouraged, thou thriveſt more then one, who can carry away a whole Sermon, and lives not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablely, and likely it is, that God may bring into thy remembrance more, according as thou ſtandeſt in need of it.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Improve what thou remembreſt by prayer and practiſe.</hi> Retire thy ſelf, and turn the <hi>Sermon</hi> into a <hi>prayer,</hi> and that will rivet it in thy memory: however turn it into <hi>practiſe,</hi> and thou wilt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it. An <hi>artiſt</hi> will never forget the <hi>rules</hi> of that <hi>trade,</hi> vvhich he daily practiſeth: Sermons are but <hi>notions</hi> to ſuch, vvho experience not the efficacy of them in their lives.</p>
                     <p>Sixteenthly, The ſixteenth ground is <hi>affectation of novelty and itching eares.</hi> This puts men upon <hi>heaping to themſelves teachers,</hi> and forſaking ſound preaching, and teachers too. The Apoſtle foretold ſuch there ſhould be in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and vve may ſafely ſay, that it is fulfilled in our daies. This is one of the great ſprings of <hi>hereſie</hi> and <hi>errour,</hi> the minde of man is <hi>novitatis avida;</hi> and hence <hi>new errour</hi> pleaſeth many more then <hi>old truth,</hi> and every <hi>new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57001:90"/> opinion, though he that runs may read it contrary to Scripture and reaſon, creates in mens minds at leaſt a ſuſpition of the truth, which all ages of the Church hath profeſſed. I am ſure Chriſt makes it the <hi>badge</hi> of his ſheep, that they will onely <hi>hear his voice,</hi> and not <hi>ſtrangers, Joh.</hi> 10. 5. his <hi>voice</hi> in his <hi>word</hi> and by his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> While men keep not to the wholeſome word of God, but affect this variety of <hi>phanſy &amp; opinion,</hi> they <hi>ſurfet,</hi> not <hi>thrive. Gellius</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gell. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 13.</note> tells us of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that he being young and <hi>Plato's</hi> ſcholar, by chance going to hear <hi>Plato,</hi> reſolved <hi>experiri an ad digna auditu tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to properatum ſtudio foret;</hi> upon which he deſerted <hi>Plato,</hi> and became <hi>Callistratus</hi> his diſciple: thus many affecting <hi>novelty,</hi> though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in profeſſion diſciples, are now <hi>turned to fables,</hi> and in ſtead of being <hi>nouriſhed</hi> by the <hi>word,</hi> are <hi>poyſoned</hi> with <hi>errour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſeventeenth ground is, <hi>Neglect of a carefull practiſe of what we hear:</hi> if men came with a reſolution to practiſe, they would go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with much more profit: for this would bring them with a great appetite and liking of the word of God: as they in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33. They profeſſed themſelves to be <hi>as in the preſence of God to hear all;</hi> that is, to hear ſo as to practiſe. This is your wiſdome, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> to come with a reſolution to practiſe: for which you have our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 7. 24. He is a wiſeman, that heareth and doth my ſayings:</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> would have us not to be <hi>hearers onely,</hi> but <hi>doers of the word,</hi> Jam. 1. 22. for ſuch onely are <hi>bleſſed</hi> in our Saviours account, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 28. I pray, conſider that propheſie of <hi>Goſpel-times,</hi> with what reſolution they invite one another to hear: viz. with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to practiſe, <hi>Eſay. 2. 3. Come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his wayes:</hi> and what more ordinary, then to call on one another in theſe dayes, <hi>Come, we will go hear ſuch a man to day?</hi> but obſerve what followes; <hi>&amp; we will walk in his ways:</hi> and do you invite one another, <hi>Brethren,</hi> for this end? nay, rather when you go to hear the word, is there not oft a ſecret <hi>reſerve</hi> in your heart to go on in your ſins? They who come with ſuch a reſolution, and not to practiſe, are not like to profit by the word. It is by this that Chriſt will have <hi>his</hi> diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples known, <hi>Joh. 8. 31. If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed:</hi> and to thoſe God tells us, that he will <hi>continue his mercy and goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 103. 17, 18. <hi>To ſuch as keep his covenant, and that remember his commandements to do them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eighteenth ground is, <hi>Anger &amp; malice either against the word, or the Miniſter of it.</hi> Many, when the word of God ſearches and findes them out, rage againſt it, or the Miniſter of it. As you may ſee they dealt with <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 54. they <hi>gnaſhed upon him with their teeth:</hi> and at verſ. 57. they <hi>ran upon him with one accord, and caſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57001:90"/> him out of the city.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts thoſe, who would <hi>ſo receive the word,</hi> as to <hi>ſave their ſouls,</hi> to <hi>receive it with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Jam.</hi> 1. 21. that is, with a milde, humble, tractable ſpirit: that as the Preacher is to <hi>inſtruct you in meekneſs, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 25. that is, with gentleneſs and tenderneſs to your perſons, with anger and zeal againſt ſin; ſo you are to hear with ſubmiſſive and tractable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33. laying aſide all enmity againſt the word and the preacher of it. And when by the word he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth you, look upon him as a <hi>Chirurgion,</hi> that comes to ſearch your ſores in order to a cure; and when he preſſeth duty, be facile and tractable. <hi>The wiſdome that is from above,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James, is gentle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>and eaſie to be intreated:</hi> and where ſhall we finde this wiſdome in men? you ſhall ſooner <hi>enrage</hi> then <hi>perſwade.</hi> As concerning the generality of men, thoſe the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>abſurd men, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. that will quarrel with the <hi>Chyrurgion,</hi> when he comes to binde up their wounds. You muſt learn, <hi>Brethren,</hi> to ſubmit to the word of God in humility, if ever you will profit by it; ſay as did <hi>Samuel, Speak, Lord, for thy ſervant heareth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The nineteenth ground is, <hi>Neglect of a ſpecial application of the word preached.</hi> Each hearer almoſt is ready to put off the word of God to another: <hi>Such a reproof concern'd not me: there the Preacher hit ſuch an one: ſuch a threatning is nothing to me:</hi> and many ſuch like. If ever you will profit by the word, you muſt do as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did: when Chriſt had told them one of them ſhould <hi>betray him,</hi> each of them applied it to himſelf, ſaying, <hi>Lord, Is it I?</hi> ſo you muſt make a particular application of <hi>promiſes, threatnings,</hi> and <hi>precepts.</hi> The beſt food will not nouriſh, unleſs it be received; you cannot live by feeding another man; no more will the word of God, except it be <hi>particularly</hi> applyed to our ſelves. It ſhould at leaſt put us upon a ſerious examination; <hi>Doth this threatning apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to me? Have I intereſt in this promiſe?</hi> The childe may <hi>ſtarve,</hi> though the mother hath a <hi>full breaſt,</hi> if it <hi>ſucks</hi> not at it: ſo we at the <hi>breaſts</hi> of the <hi>promiſes,</hi> unleſs by the Application of a <hi>particular faith,</hi> we make them our own. We muſt not onely hear of the promiſes ſlightly, but we muſt ſearch them out, and that ſo as we may <hi>know them for our good, Job</hi> 5. 27. In a Princes <hi>proclamation,</hi> every one will look to that which concerns himſelf; ſo ſhould we in the <hi>proclamation</hi> of the Goſpel, look to that which in <hi>particular</hi> concerns us, and in <hi>particular</hi> apply it to us. And therefore you may obſerve, that when God makes the word to be effectual, he does it by a particular application of it to the ſoul; as in that of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the man:</hi> for it is true that <hi>Job</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Job 33. 14.

                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:57001:91"/> but then in verſ. 6. <hi>He openeth their ears, and ſealeth their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> that is, by a particular application of the word. I know there are and may be miſcarriages here: the <hi>preſumptuous</hi> ſinner is too ready to <hi>catch at,</hi> and run away with a <hi>promiſe:</hi> the <hi>humbled dejected</hi> ſinner to <hi>deſpair</hi> under <hi>threatnings:</hi> A great piece of wiſdome it is to apply the word ſuitably to our conditions: if <hi>fainting,</hi> the <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> if <hi>ſecure,</hi> the <hi>threatnings:</hi> and this is ſo <hi>to be wiſe,</hi> as <hi>to be wiſe for ones ſelf,</hi> Prov. 9. 12. and ſo to profit by the word.</p>
                     <p>And this is the ſecond ground of unprofitable hearing in regard of <hi>Hearers:</hi> the third ground is in reſpect of the <hi>Word it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third General ground of unprofitable hearing is in regard of the <hi>Word it ſelf.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>How is it poſsible that the word it ſelf ſhould be a cauſe of unprofitableneſs,</hi> which Scripture ſo much magnifies, and dignifies with ſuch glorious titles, that ſpeak the power of it. As that, <hi>The Goſpel is our ſalvation,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. <hi>The ſword of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 17. <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit and righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8, 9. and that <hi>it is the power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16?

                        </gap> 2 Tim. 3. 16. but through <hi>mens corruptions,</hi> it becomes <hi>unprofitable,</hi> becauſe <hi>common:</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at firſt admired the <hi>Manna,</hi> but afterward loathed it, when it grew common, and began to entertain <hi>longings</hi> after their <hi>onions,</hi> and <hi>garlick</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and we may ſee how they quarel, and murmure at it, <hi>Numb,</hi> 11. 5, 6. Oh diſingenuous ingratitude! what could they have <hi>better</hi> then meat from heaven? I wiſh this were not the language of many! <hi>what, nothing but this preaching?</hi> the old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was, that, <hi>men were like to periſh for want of viſion:</hi> now men begin to <hi>ſurfeit</hi> on it. Mans corrupt nature affects <hi>variety,</hi> never long pleaſed with the ſame thing, and long enjoyment breeds a diſrelliſh in us of the beſt things, we prize <hi>pearls,</hi> cheifely, becauſe <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>coſtly:</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> wore them upon their ſhoes, when common: <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones emergere è luto cupiunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertull. much adoe to keep them out of the dirt:</hi> thus the <hi>pearl</hi> of the Goſpel is troden <hi>under foot,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>common.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> prize not precious pearls ſo much becauſe common; which our Merchants venture expence and danger to procure: many prize not the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which the Merchant ſells all for, that he may purchaſe it. And how do we diſeſteem that means of grace which many a dark cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the nation would be thankefull to enjoy? I pray God we be not taught at length how to value our plenty of the <hi>bread of life</hi> more by the want of it.</p>
                     <p>How do they prize the <hi>ſalutes</hi> of the ſun, who have half a years

The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſure never prized <hi>light</hi> ſo much, as when they had experienced the <hi>plague</hi> of <hi>darkneſs.</hi> How would thouſands in the nation, in the world, <hi>prize</hi> that light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which we <hi>under-value,</hi> and grow wanton under? It is indeed much pitie and ſhame to us, that good food ſhould be <hi>nauſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> becauſe often ſet before us: it is a ſign our ſtomachs are not good; our ſpiritual appetites are diſtempered. The Scripture ſpeaks fully to the ready and chearfull entertainment of the <hi>Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound,</hi> when it was firſt preached to the Gentiles, as appears by the inſtances of <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s whole family, of <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> yea, even <hi>Ceſars</hi> houſhold at <hi>Rome,</hi> Philip. 4. 11. and from the ſudden and large ſpreading of the Goſpel in <hi>Rome, Corinth, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and the reſt. See we how it was in the days of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 14. the publick exerciſe of the prophetical office was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed by the <hi>negligence</hi> of old <hi>Eli,</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of his <hi>ſons. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci erant pii in populo, &amp; his erat pretioſum verbum, quia rarò fiebat ejus audiendi copia:</hi> ſo <hi>Paraeus</hi> upon the place. When preaching was more rare, ſome would have <hi>travelled</hi> to hear a ſermon, who will not now ſtir <hi>out of doors</hi> for it: and this muſt needs cauſe unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs; for while men have low thoughts of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> they will profit little by it. What the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov. 25. 17. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thy foot from thy neighbours houſe, leſt he be weary of thee;</hi> may be applyed to this thus; That men are apt to <hi>nauſeate</hi> the word of God, becauſe ſo oft enjoyed by them. Men look at it as a <hi>matter of courſe,</hi> and regard not the <hi>inſtitution and Ordinance</hi> of God, and ſo under-valuing it, remain unprofitable under it. See how God layes this to the charge of Iſrael, <hi>Hoſ. 8. 12. I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing. Written to him</hi>] in <hi>contradiſtinction</hi> to all other people; yet he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteems them. <hi>Singulari privilegio &amp; eximio illos prae aliis ornavi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Paraus in loc.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; ipſi ſúsque déque habent, quaſi rem nihili:</hi> ſo <hi>Paraeus.</hi> And this charge it is to be feared, may be laid to many in theſe days, who pretend fair to the word of God.</p>
                     <p>The fourth <hi>General ground</hi> is in reſpect of <hi>God. Unprofitableneſs,</hi> as a <hi>ſin,</hi> cannot come from God, but as a <hi>puniſhment</hi> of mens former neglect, and wilfull contempt of the word of God: for though Gods holineſs permits him not to have any hand in ſin, as <hi>ſin,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>contrariety</hi> to his <hi>nature,</hi> and that which he indiſpenſably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, yet God may will ſin as a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> not out of <hi>love</hi> to the <hi>ſin,</hi> but to puniſh the perſon: for though ſin be <hi>intrinſecally</hi> evil, yet the manifeſtation of Gods juſtice is good: and God for former
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57001:92"/> provocations oft judicially leaves the creature, and permits him to fall into further ſin, as he dealt with the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. and ſo was the <hi>incest</hi> of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as a puniſhment of <hi>Davids adultery, 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 11. Now God proceeds judicially againſt thoſe who live unprofitably under the word, theſe eight wayes.</p>
                     <p>I. Sometimes God proceeds in ſeverity againſt <hi>their perſons, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines</hi> and <hi>deſtroyes</hi> them. If Chriſt comes year after year into the <hi>vineyard,</hi> and findes the <hi>fig-tree</hi> to <hi>bear no fruit,</hi> he gives commiſſion to <hi>cut it down,</hi> Luke 13. 7. When God expects, <hi>brethren,</hi> your <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> under the means, and finds you unprofitable, his wrath is provoked, and you cut up as a burthen to the earth; ſo Matth. 3. 10. Thus God dealt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> 2 Chron. 36. 15, 16. he bare with them a long time, till there was no remedie. God will not always endure to have his <hi>meſſengers</hi> and <hi>meſſages</hi> contemned. Read <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7. 12, 13, 14. and ſee there how God dealt with <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and what he threatens to do to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the reaſon of all was <hi>their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs,</hi> as we ſee at ver. 10. they pretended fair to the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>houſe</hi> of God, yet did they not <hi>profit</hi> ſo, as to leave their ſins: for this God threats their ruine.</p>
                     <p>II. Sometimes he <hi>denyes</hi> and <hi>with-draws</hi> that <hi>grace from them,</hi> by which they may be enabled to profit; and thus God may be ſaid to <hi>concur</hi> to mens <hi>unprofitableneſs;</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> may be ſaid to be the cauſe of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> by with-drawing its light. When men obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſiſt the ſtrivings of the Spirit in the miniſtery of the word: God ſaith, <hi>My Spirit ſhall no longer ſtrive with him.</hi> As he ſaith, <hi>Hoſ. 4. 17. Ephraim is joyned to idols; let him alone:</hi> and in <hi>Revel. 22. 11. He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill:</hi> ſo, <hi>he that is unprofitable, let him be unprofitable ſtill.</hi> Oh ſad judgement! and is as ſadly expreſſed, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66, the 3, and 4. <hi>They have choſen their own ways, and their ſoul delights in their abominations: I alſo will chooſe their deluſions, &amp;c.</hi> which is as much as to ſay, he will leave them to themſelves, and ſuffer them to go on to be deluded by thoſe deluſions, as ſuch they having wilfuly choſen. Men care not to profit by the word, and God gives them over to unprofitableneſs, as Chriſt curſed the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 19.</p>
                     <p>III. <hi>By taking the Goſpel wholly away,</hi> and <hi>removing the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick from them.</hi> Thus Chriſt threatned to proceed againſt <hi>Epheſus,</hi> unleſs by a <hi>ſpeedy return</hi> ſhe <hi>prevented</hi> it, <hi>Rev. 2. 5. Jeruſalem</hi> was come to the height of wickedneſs, when the Goſpel was removed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37, 38. The <hi>Jews</hi> by a wilfull contempt firſt <hi>put away</hi> the Goſpel from themſelves, before God took it away from them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſſely, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. God will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways caſt this <hi>pearl</hi> before <hi>ſwine,</hi> who, as <hi>Clemens</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57001:92"/> more in the mud of their luſts, then in the pure waters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the word of God.</hi> God will not always caſt his <hi>childrens bread</hi> to the <hi>dogs.</hi> God threatens a famine of the word upon the Jews, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. Would you know the reaſon? ſee ver. 5. they began to be weary of it, and unprofitable under it. As a <hi>maſter</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deals with a bad <hi>ſervant,</hi> pulls his <hi>livery</hi> over his ears, and turns him out of doors; ſo God oft deals with men, takes away his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> his <hi>livery</hi> and <hi>cognizance:</hi> or, as a man divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an <hi>adulterous</hi> wife, takes away all her <hi>jewels</hi> and <hi>garments,</hi> and puts them upon another; ſo God, when people go a <hi>whoring, takes away from them</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which are the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>ornament</hi> of a nation, and gives them to others.</p>
                     <p>IV. <hi>If he does continue the Goſpel, yet he takes away the able and faithful Miniſters of it.</hi> Obſerve how God dealt with his vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. great expence you may ſee he had been at, verſ. 2. ſo much, that he appeals to their own judgements, <hi>what</hi> he <hi>could have done more,</hi> what coſt he ſhould further beſtow upon them, as to <hi>outward means,</hi> ver. 4. but there being no ſuitable <hi>thriving</hi> under all this, ſee how the Lord proceeds judicially againſt it: after the threatning of a <hi>totall devastation,</hi> ver. 5. he adds, <hi>that the clouds ſhould rain no more upon it.</hi> So doth God deal with an unprofitable people, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves theſe <hi>clouds</hi> (as Miniſters are called) who are to <hi>drop fatneſs</hi> into the ſoul, and lets you ſit under <hi>clouds without water,</hi> and none of the <hi>dews of heaven</hi> in them to make you <hi>thrive.</hi> And how hath God dealt of late in this Nation, removing from us many <hi>eminent Preachers,</hi> and pulling down many <hi>pillars</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> And may we not juſtly fear, that this hath been by many mens <hi>unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>wantonneſs</hi> under the word of God? Is it not a ſign that Gods vineyard hath brought forth little fruit? when God hath <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed</hi> ſo many <hi>ſtars</hi> of the <hi>firſt magnitude?</hi> Is it not to be feared it is becauſe men have neglected to walk by, and improve the <hi>light</hi> of thoſe, who have held out the Goſpel to them?</p>
                     <p>V. <hi>By taking away the Miniſters gifts.</hi> The people are apt to complain of nothing more, then that their preachers want <hi>abilities</hi> and <hi>gifts:</hi> perhaps it is a judgement upon your unprofitableneſs under, and abuſe of the word. Alas! the Miniſter is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>divine influence,</hi> and <hi>communication</hi> in his <hi>miniſterial endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It is God that gives <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. And he may oft-times with-draw this influence. God may <hi>dry up</hi> the <hi>breaſt,</hi> becauſe you thrive not by the <hi>ſincere milk</hi> of the<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hom. 12. in Ezek.</hi> 3. 26.</note> word. <hi>Propter malum populum, etiam bonis tollitur ſermo doctoribus,</hi> ſo <hi>Gregorie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>VI. <hi>By denying ſucceſs to the word preached, though he continue able
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57001:93"/> Miniſters.</hi> God muſt <hi>give the increaſe,</hi> even when a <hi>Paul preacheth,</hi> and an <hi>Apollos waters;</hi> which he is pleaſed oft to deny. Becauſe of our <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of his word, and <hi>careleſneſs</hi> to profit under it, he denies the <hi>dews</hi> of his <hi>bleſsing,</hi> which ſhould make the ſeed of the word thrive and proſper. Or, if the Miniſter preaches <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> yet perhaps not <hi>ſuitably</hi> to thy neceſſities, not what may profit; and this by a ſecret judgement of God upon thy obſtinate unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs under former enjoyments of the word. You have a very pregnant inſtance of this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 26. where God tells the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he ſhould be <hi>dumb,</hi> and not be a <hi>reprover</hi> unto them: and theſe <hi>reproofs</hi> (as I have often hinted) are moſt like to profit; as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes, <hi>Magna omnipotentis Dei gratia eſt, cùm iniquè agentibus</hi>

God forſakes not <hi>any</hi> till they <hi>obstinately</hi> forſake <hi>him: non deſerit niſi deſerentem.</hi> Chriſt did not preſently diſcharge himſelf of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> but after many <hi>calls</hi> and <hi>warnings</hi> and <hi>wilful

Let us then improve this time of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and the Goſpel, while we enjoy it, leſt through the <hi>hardneſs of our heart</hi> under it, we <hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Rom. 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>The fifth General ground of unprofitable hearing is in reſpect of <hi>Satan,</hi> who doth what he can to make the word unprofitable, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways and devices Satan hath to compaſs this end. Sometimes he is at your <hi>elbow jogging</hi> you <hi>aſleep,</hi> that men <hi>ſleep away</hi> a Sermon: ſometimes he <hi>ſteals away</hi> the word you have received, which our Saviour expreſſeth by <hi>the ſeed that fell by the ways ſide,</hi> Matth. 13. 4, and 19. otherwhile he preſents your thoughts with the <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the world, and ſo they are <hi>wandring</hi> and <hi>distracted:</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>begetting prejudices</hi> in your hearts againſt the word, or the preacher of it, and ſo <hi>diſaffecting</hi> you to the truth preached: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſuggeſting ſuitable motions</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> to ſteal away your hearts from the word, as to the <hi>voluptuous</hi> mans <hi>pleaſure,</hi> to the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious</hi> man <hi>honours;</hi> ſo ſuiting their corruptions, and by that they prove careleſs to profit by the word. And the truth is, the more powerfull the word is, the more the devil oppoſes it; and the more the light of the Goſpel hath appeared, the more hath Satan ſent out the <hi>ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit</hi> to <hi>obſcure</hi> it; and therefore though the multitude of <hi>hereſies</hi> &amp; <hi>errours</hi> which abound among us be real matter of a <hi>lamentation,</hi> as being a ſign that the devil hath ſet his <hi>cloven foot</hi> amongſt us; yet I cannot but from hence conclude, there is agreater power of <hi>Goſpel-light,</hi> which the devil thus endeavours to <hi>extinguiſh;</hi> it appears, that the <hi>ſun</hi> is <hi>up,</hi> that theſe <hi>locuſts</hi> ſwarm ſo. If now you ask me; why the devil ſo much oppoſes the word and Goſpel? I anſwer</p>
                     <p>I. <hi>Becauſe himſelf hath no ſhare in it:</hi> he is fallen irrecoverablely from God and as an <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>II. <hi>Becauſe it is a means to ruin and demoliſh his kingdome.</hi> The word of God is <hi>mighty to throw down Satans ſtrong holds,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. whereby he keeps poſſeſſion of the ſoul. As the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down at the noiſe of <hi>rams horns,</hi> ſo at the ſound of the Goſpel the walls of Satan fall down. Some ſtones out of <hi>this brook</hi> will conquer
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57001:94"/> our <hi>Goliah:</hi> this <hi>ſword of the Spirit</hi> conquers Satan, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6. 17. When Chriſt had ſent out his ſeventy diſciples to preach, the effect of it was; that Satan fell like <hi>lightning out of heaven,</hi> Luke 10. 18. that is, that power and dominion he exerciſed before in the world. This was one end for which God ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Acts 26. 17, 18. Hence it is that Satan employs all his <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> againſt it; for where the word comes in power, the devil is a looſer by it: he looſeth a <hi>ſubject</hi> of his kingdome, who by the word is brought from under his obedience. While men remain his <hi>ſubjects;</hi> he lets them alone quietyly, all is in peace while the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> keeps the houſe; but when the Goſpel comes to bring his ſubjects to the obedience of God, then he raiſeth all the force he can againſt it by himſelf and wicked men. He hath the poſſeſſion of our <hi>corrupt hearts,</hi> and therefore will not ſubmit to a diſ-poſſeſsion without much reſiſtance. The Goſpel brings us from under Satans power by a pure conqueſt; for he will not deliver his right and poſſeſsion upon terms. The devil looks upon it as his <hi>interest</hi> to oppoſe the Goſpel to uphold and ſecure his ovvn kingdome. Obſerve vvhat the Apoſtle ſuys expreſſely to this, 2 <hi>Cor 4. 4. The God of this world hath blinded the eyes of them, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel ſhould ſhine unto them:</hi> vvhen the Goſpel ſhines in his full luſtre, the devil endeavours to blinde men vvith <hi>wilfull unbelief,</hi> that they ſee it not. The <hi>ultimate end</hi> that Satan aims at in this is the ruine of their ſouls: and therefore, in order to it, is carefull, that they come not to the knovvledge of the truth, <hi>without which is no ſalvation,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. vvhich he knovvs they cannot do, vvithout the ſhining of the <hi>light</hi> of the Goſpel into their hearts, and therefore endeavours to hinder it vvhat he can. The <hi>Prince of darkneſs</hi> rules in dark ignorant ſouls, holds them by thoſe <hi>chains of darkneſs,</hi> and endeavours to ſhut their eyes, leſt by the <hi>light of the Goſpel</hi> they ſhould <hi>diſcover</hi> the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions</hi> by which he hath held them <hi>captive,</hi> and ſo theſe ſhould be taken from under his obedience: as in the day we diſcover the vanity of our <hi>night-phantaſies, dreams</hi> and <hi>imaginations.</hi> In a vvord, <hi>Satan looſeth where the word profiteth, therefore he doth all he can to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</hi>

                     <p>I. <hi>Go to the word as the word, and for the word,</hi> So thou meeteſt with the wholeſome word of God, regard not the dreſs it comes in: <hi>Bonorum ingeniorum inſignis est indoles in verbis verum amare, non</hi>

                  <p>4. <hi>In order to the common and publick ſecuritie, that by one mans puniſhment others may fear to ſin.</hi> Which is the account <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of Gods appointment of <hi>capital</hi> puniſhments under the judicial law: as the <hi>ſeducer from the true worſhip of God</hi> was by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be <hi>ſtoned,</hi> Deut. 13. 10. and the end is expreſſed, <hi>verſe 11. that all Iſrael might hear and fear, and do no more ſuch wickedneſs.</hi> And the <hi>falſe witneſs</hi> to be puniſhed, <hi>Deut. 19. 19, 20. That thoſe which remain may no more commit any ſuch evil amongſt you.</hi> That which is a puniſhment to one becomes a terrour to all. Beſides, puniſhments are neceſſarie for the protection of weak and unarmed innocencie; to which Magiſtrates are, or ſhould be, a refuge and ſhelter; and which is chief, for the ſecuritie and defence of the Laws, which would be every villains ſcorn and deriſion, if they were not <hi>hedged in with thorns</hi> (as I may ſay) and ſecured by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. For though the moſt ingenuous principle of <hi>obedience</hi> be <hi>love,</hi> yet the moſt common principle is <hi>fear:</hi> and thoſe who will not for <hi>conſcience ſake,</hi> as the Apoſtle commands, <hi>Rom. 13. 5. conform</hi> to the Laws, yet will for <hi>wraths ſake,</hi> for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and many whom <hi>Religion</hi> will not, <hi>Policie</hi> will oblige to obedience. God ſees it neceſſarie to ſecure his own Laws by annexing puniſhments to them: mans corrupt nature is become now <hi>ſervile,</hi> and with thoſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3. would think of <hi>breaking all bands in ſunder,</hi> and <hi>caſting away the cords</hi> of Gods commands <hi>from them,</hi> did they not fear as it follows there, <hi>v.</hi> 9. to <hi>be bruiſed with the rod of iron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many keep Gods Laws more out of fear of Hell, then out of any love to Holineſs: and much more invalid will any humane Laws be without puniſhments annexed. If men could promiſe themſelves ſecuritie from the puniſhment which the Law threatens, they would quickly indulge themſelves the libertie of violating what the Law commands. I like not indeed <hi>Draco's</hi> Laws, which were ſo cruel, that they were ſaid to be <hi>written in bloud,</hi> not with <hi>ink;</hi> nor approve of <hi>Caligula's</hi> decrees, which were termed <hi>furo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, non judicia:</hi> and ſurely capital puniſhments, ſhould then onely be inflicted, when the Laws cannot be ſecured, nor the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57001:100"/> and peace preſerved without them. But without ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither can be ſafe; the Magiſtrates authoritie would be contemned, and the Laws, like Cobwebs, ſwept down by every hand: and therefore thoſe ſame men (I mean the <hi>Socinians</hi> and others) who inveigh againſt all <hi>puniſhments</hi> (eſpecially, if <hi>capital</hi>) as a <hi>breach of charitie,</hi> charge the Laws too, as a violation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie:</hi> theſe are timely to be looked too. Magiſtrates in Scripture are called <hi>Phyſitians;</hi> it is a cruel pitie in a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> to<note place="margin">Iſa. 3. 6, 7.</note> ſpare an ounce or two of corrupt bloud, and thereby endanger the <hi>health</hi> of the whole bodie.

                  <p>By this time, I hope, you ſee the Magiſtrates right to puniſh them who <hi>do wrong;</hi> but leſt the great <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the world might here take ſanctuarie, and becauſe of their own <hi>power</hi> or <hi>policie,</hi> or of the Magiſtrates <hi>cowardize</hi> or <hi>partialitie,</hi> they may hope to eſcape the <hi>ſtroke</hi> of the <hi>civil</hi> ſword, and ſo be encouraged to tyrannize and wrong others, let them know they ſhall certainly receive at the hand of God <hi>for what ever wrong they do,</hi> &amp;c. that brings me to the</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Improve all by ſome application.</hi> For the firſt, God hath a <hi>peculiar people</hi> in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>I. In reſpect of <hi>outward diſpenſation,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</hi> Thus the Jews of old were <hi>Gods peculiar:</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> whom<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 5.</note> he calls his <hi>peculiar treaſure.</hi> God cauſed his Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be diſpenſed amongſt them, which the reſt of the world were ſtrangers to; he entruſted them with his divine oracles, which the Apoſtle notes as their <hi>distinguiſhing priviledge</hi> from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> as their <hi>peculiar prerogative.</hi> The reſt of the<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 1, 2. Pſal. 147. 19, 20.</note> world were like the dry barren Wilderneſs, they God's Encloſure, his Vineyard, who had plentifull ſhowres of the dew of heaven fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon them: and ſo they ſhall be part of Gods peculiar again: the Scripture gives us evident ground to believe their <hi>converſion to the faith,</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. from verſe 23. to verſe 28. I think we are much in the dark as to the time of their reſtitution: I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Idolatrie of <hi>Rome</hi> (which is the Jews greateſt <hi>stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block</hi>) muſt firſt be removed, Religion reformed. This may be a digreſſion (however it is but a ſhort one) as to the Text, but not to the Intendment of the <hi>Lecture.</hi> And in this reſpect likewiſe the Chriſtian part of the world is <hi>God's peculiar,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from Pagans, and Mahometans, and the reſt: in the Chriſtian part of the world, <hi>England</hi> is God's peculiar: in <hi>England,</hi> let me ſay, <hi>London</hi> is God's peculiar; a place like <hi>Capernaum, exalted up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in the uſe and enjoyment of Ordinances; I heartily pray it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have <hi>Capernaum's</hi> doom, to be <hi>thrown down to hell</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and abuſe of them.</p>
                  <p>II. In reſpect of <hi>ſpecial office</hi> and <hi>employment.</hi> Thus Magiſtrates
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57001:109"/> are God's peculiar, (he hath honoured them with his <hi>own</hi> name in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6.) peculiarly repreſenting his Dominion; his Deputies and Vicegerents on earth; they <hi>rule by him, Prov.</hi> 8. 15. and ſhould for him; they are his Miniſters, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. Thus alſo the Miniſters are God's peculiar, in reſpect of <hi>Function:</hi> as the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was under the Law; as being a ſpecial right of Ordination ſet apart for ſpecial ſervices. <hi>Separate me Barnabas and Saul,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them,</hi> Acts 13. 2. which you may ſee was done accordingly, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. by <hi>faſting and prayer,</hi> and <hi>laying on of hands.</hi> The Miniſterial office lies not in <hi>common</hi> to all: but there muſt be ſuch a <hi>calling,</hi> and <hi>laſting function</hi> as <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. You may finde them diſtinguiſhed expreſly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>unto you, and unto the reſt:</hi> whence the Miniſtry in antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The Magiſtrates dutie is to uphold, but not to exerciſe theſe peculiar acts; which when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor would have been intermeddling with, he received this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe by S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that, <hi>his ſcarlet made him a Magiſtrate, not a Minister.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. In reſpect of <hi>ſpecial grace and favour:</hi> though God bear an <hi>univerſal philanthropie</hi> to all men as his <hi>creatures;</hi> yet he loves ſome with ſpecial love and diſtinguiſhing favour: which <hi>David</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 4.</note> prayed to God he might have the experience of, <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the favour thou beareſt unto thy people.</hi> Thus God hath a peculiar people in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of <hi>choiſe</hi> and <hi>purpoſe;</hi> ſo many, who at preſent lie in <hi>common</hi> with the reſt of the world, not yet effectually brought home by the power of God's Word and Spirit, (I mean <hi>elected</hi> though <hi>unconverted</hi> perſons) are God's peculiar. Many of God's jewels lie a long time in the mire and ſink of the world. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>choſen veſſel,</hi> though at preſent <hi>breathing out blaſphemies and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</hi>

                  <p>II. This <hi>peculiarity</hi> appears in the <hi>undertakings</hi> of Chriſt: and here is a four-fold peculiarity.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of a <hi>peculiar covenant</hi> and <hi>ſtipulation</hi> with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the bringing home ſuch a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> given into his hands as Mediatour; <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Hebr. 10. 7.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of a <hi>peculiar purchaſe,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. <hi>To redeem them that were under the law:</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: <hi>a purchaſed people,</hi> it is in the margins of your Bibles: <hi>populus acquiſitionis,</hi> in the <hi>Vulgar. He lays down his</hi>

                     <hi>life for his ſheep:</hi> unbelievers are none of thoſe ſheep. It was his <hi>Church</hi> onely, <hi>which he purchaſed with his own bloud,</hi> Acts 20. 28.<note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> Chriſt <hi>loved his Church and gave himſelf for it,</hi> Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27. It is <hi>his people</hi> onely which he <hi>ſaveth from their ſins,</hi> Matth. 1. 21. And where Chriſt is ſaid to die for <hi>all men,</hi> and for <hi>the world,</hi> you are to interpret it of <hi>all ſorts</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of men, of <hi>every kindred,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5. 9.</note>

And as to that middle reconciling opinion, ſo much contended for at this time, that, <hi>Christ died intentionally for all upon the condition of believing, and yet with a ſpecial intention, according to the determinate purpoſe of his Father, of actual beſtowing faith and ſalvation upon certain perſons;</hi> it is, I profeſs to you, to me (pardon my weakneſs) a moſt unintelligible thing, (Will any wiſe man pay a <hi>ranſome</hi> for a <hi>captive,</hi> and at the ſame time intend that the <hi>captive</hi> ſhall have no benefit by it? It makes Chriſts death to be <hi>in vain</hi> to the greateſt part of the world; whereas Scripture tells us, that not <hi>one</hi> ſoul ſhall miſcarry, <hi>John</hi> 10. 15. and ſhall any of thoſe ſheep <hi>finally</hi> miſcarry, compared with verſ. 28.) unleſs it be aſſerted that the <hi>condition</hi> of faith be in every mans power, either by his <hi>natural abilities,</hi> which is down-right <hi>Pelagianiſme;</hi> or elſe by ſome <hi>ſupernatural grace</hi> given to all, which is <hi>ſemipelagianiſme,</hi> and both which the patrons of this opinion diſ-own. For Chriſt to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57001:113"/> die to eſtabliſh a <hi>covenant</hi> with all men, upon an <hi>impoſsible condition,</hi> is as much illuſory, as if he had not died for them at all: for an <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical promiſe</hi> upon an <hi>impoſsible condition</hi> is equivalent to a <hi>pure negation,</hi> as any know who are the leaſt acquainted with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And therefore (till <hi>I</hi> can ſee further light to the contrary) <hi>I</hi> muſt think it moſt rational to proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>end,</hi> and ſo extend the death and purchaſe of Chriſt, to no greater latitude then to the purpoſe of God, for the carrying on of which it was deſigned; unleſs it be underſtood onely of <hi>ſufficiencie of price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. In reſpect of a <hi>peculiar interceſsion.</hi> Chriſts interceding at his Fathers <hi>right hand</hi> is diſcriminate, <hi>Joh. 17. 9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> And this I humbly conceive to be a good argument <hi>à majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> to prove the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of Chriſts <hi>purchaſe:</hi> for undoubtedly Chriſt would not have grudged the expence of a <hi>prayer</hi> on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of thoſe, for whom he ſhed his <hi>bloud;</hi> for, certainly, Chriſts <hi>interceſsion</hi> is in purſuit of his <hi>purchaſe;</hi> the effect of which is the <hi>actual beſtowing</hi> of what he here bought for them by his bloud, viz. <hi>faith, perſeverance,</hi> which are the fruits of Chriſts prayer, as appears by his ſpeech to Peter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32. Now this <hi>interceſsion</hi> is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate to a <hi>peculiar</hi> people even to the <hi>elect,</hi> (and yet is of equal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with his death) <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? it is Chriſt that died,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 33, 34.) <hi>who alſo makes interceſsion for us.</hi> And unqueſtionably had Chriſt given himſelf and now interceded for all, all ſhould be made partakers of ſpiritual ſaving bleſſings; for as the Apoſtle ſaith Rom. 8. 32. <hi>he that ſpared not his own ſon, but delivered him up for us; how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> and John 11. 42. <hi>Father, I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me, and I knew that thou heareſt me always, Non dubito</hi> (ſaith <hi>Vaſquez) Chriſtum peculiari oratione &amp; voluntate</hi>

                  <p>4.

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:57001:114"/>
                  <p>III. This <hi>peculiarity</hi> appears in the <hi>peculiar workings</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and here is a four-fold peculiarity.</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of <hi>peculiar illumination.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the ſhortneſs of <hi>natural light,</hi> as to <hi>ſaving</hi> diſcoveries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 14. yet addes ver. 10. <hi>but God hath revealed them to us by his ſpirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſo in that moſt excellent Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. having ſaid ver. 3, 4. that <hi>the Goſpel is hid to thoſe that are loſt,</hi> he addes ver. 6. an intimation of a <hi>ſpecial illumination</hi> indulged to Saints: <hi>For</hi> (however he dealt with others) <hi>God, who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. David</hi> makes this an argument in begging <hi>illumination</hi> of God, <hi>I am thy ſervant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 125.) <hi>give me underſtanding.</hi> A wicked man may have much <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> illumination, but ſuch as vaſtly differs from the illumination of the <hi>Saints:</hi> thoſe <hi>puff</hi> them up with <hi>pride,</hi> theſe <hi>humble</hi> them; though I confeſs, this <hi>leaven</hi> is apt to infect the beſt, as <hi>Paul 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Notwithſtanding thoſe, the ſoul ſtands at a <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>enmitie</hi> from Chriſt, nay oft <hi>apoſtatizeth</hi> from the profeſſion of him: but<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> theſe bring the ſoul effectually to <hi>cloſe</hi> with Chriſt; <hi>Every man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh. 6. 45.) that hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> That's a <hi>head-floating</hi> illumination, this an <hi>heart-affecting</hi> illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: that, like the light of a <hi>glow-worm,</hi> which hath no heat in it, this like the light of the <hi>ſun</hi> warmeth and quickneth where it comes: it is called the <hi>light of life</hi> Joh. 8. 12. it provokes Saints to <hi>love</hi> God and to <hi>trust</hi> in God, <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. they which know thy name will put their truſt in thee. Common</hi> illumination in a wicked man is like the ſun ſhining upon a <hi>dung-hill,</hi> calls out its ſtench and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, whereas this illumination is a <hi>heart-changing</hi> and a <hi>life-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> knowledge. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of a <hi>peculiar ſanctification</hi> ſo in the text, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>4. In reſpect of <hi>ſpecial and peculiar communions with God,</hi> Eph. 2. 18. <hi>For through him we both have an acceſs by one ſpirit to the father: through Chriſt,</hi> as Mediatour meriting our acceſs to God, <hi>by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> directing and aſſiſting us in our addreſſes to him: 1 <hi>John 1. 3.

So to aſſert any fore-ſeen conditions in us, as the motives of God's eternal love, is to rob God of the glory which he hath of peculiarizing a people to himſelf; for, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, God did not chooſe us, but we him; whereas the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>John 4. 19, We love God becauſe he first loved us.</hi> God loves his people into holineſs, not becauſe they were ſo, either in themſelves, or in his fore-ſight: no, <hi>When I ſaw thee polluted in thy bloud, behold, this time was the time of love,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6, 8.

They think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, ſpeaking evil of you.</hi> Beloved, if ſeriouſly weighed, it is no matter of wonder; for they have peculiar engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to holineſs upon them: the preſence of diſtinguiſhing love to engage them againſt ſin; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> argues from the ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had received from his Maſter, to the avoidance of injuring him, <hi>Gen</hi> 39. 9. ſo Saints from determinating love. <hi>Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me;</hi> and is not a redeemed bondſlave under ſpecial engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of homage to his Lord? <hi>What, ſhall I wound my Saviour by ſin, who hath already been wounded for it?</hi> Beſides, Saints are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their engagements.

                     <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 26. 3.) <hi>is before mine eyes.</hi> Their ſlips are more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God, then the ſins of others. God's honour is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his ways reproached by reaſon of their ſins; therefore in tenderneſs to the honour of God, they are engaged in a fear of, and watchfulneſs againſt ſin; beſides, they have a principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acting them to holineſs: they have experience of the <hi>beauties of holineſs,</hi> and that peace which the practiſe of it brings in to them: and they have more to loſe then others by ſin, the ſenſe of Love, the ſmiles of a Father, the light of God's countenance. They cannot ſin ſo cheap as others can; you may pardon them well, if they fear the loſs of their peace, Divine Eclipſes and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; if they dread <hi>broken bones,</hi> which a <hi>David</hi> cries out of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 8. after a wilfull ſin.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Unto thankfulneſs.</hi> Pſal. 135. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ye that ſtand in the houſe of the Lord, in the courts of our God, praiſe the Lord, for the Lord is good, for the Lord hath choſen Jacob unto himſelf, and Iſrael for his peculiar treaſure.</hi> Special praiſes ſhould be the Echo of peculiar mercies. You may finde the Church magnifying Chriſt upon this very account, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. The Doctrine of <hi>univerſalitie of grace</hi> deſtroys all thankfulneſs, unleſs to our ſelves; makes all the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of praiſes needleſs, <hi>ſacrificing to our own nets,</hi> applauding the power and freedome of our own wills. It is diſcriminating grace will raiſe the ſoul to thankfull admirations of God, in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Judas</hi> (not <hi>Iſcariot) Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the world,</hi> John 14. 22.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>To love;</hi> both to <hi>God,</hi> who thus peculiariz'd you, and to love one another. However your heads may differ, let your hearts u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: you are <hi>Temples</hi> of the ſame <hi>Spirit; ſpouſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; members</hi> of the ſame <hi>bodie, 1 Cor.</hi> 12 25, 27. and (what greater argument of love?) you are purchaſed by the ſame bloud, ſanctified by the ſame Spirit, objects of the ſame ſpecial love; and, I am ſure, the Apoſtle from hence argues ſtrongly for <hi>brotherly love: Beloved, if God ſo loved us,</hi> (ſaith he, 1 <hi>John 4. 10, 11.) we ought alſo to love one another.</hi> You are <hi>eodem ſanguine glutinati,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine expreſſeth it:</hi> and is <hi>Chriſt divided?</hi> It is the check the Apoſtle gives to the uncharitable diſſentions of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 13. And laſtly you are deſigned for the ſame glorie.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>To ſpecial ſervice for, and obedience to God.</hi> Diſcriminating mercies are in all reaſon to be improved as arguments to peculiar ſervices: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Matth. 5. 47. What do ye more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:57001:116"/> as if he had ſaid; <hi>more is expected from my diſciples, then from the Publicans; as your priviledges are peculiar, ſo ſhould your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices be too;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>This is the proper intendment of distinguiſhing mercie: the end of God's peculiar diſpenſations to a perſon or nation.</hi> Obſerve what God ſaith of Iſrael, <hi>Deut. 26. 18. The Lord hath avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee this day to be his peculiar people:</hi> but to what end? <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt keep his commandments.</hi> Hath God diſtinguiſhed thee by Electing love? the end of it is thy Holineſs: <hi>He hath choſen us that we may be holy, and without blame before him,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. Hath he peculiariz'd thee by Effectual grace and Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It is that thou mayſt be <hi>holy,</hi> 1 Theſſal. 4. 7. <hi>For God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs.</hi> Art thou Chriſt's by a peculiar purchaſe? the end of it is thy Holineſs, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 20. For you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your bodies, and in your ſpirits.</hi> Hath God exerciſed any peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences towards thee? the end of them is thy obedience. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> having ſpoken of all the Providences God exerciſed over Iſrael, infers this as the juſt iſſue of them; <hi>That they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his ſtatutes and keep his laws,</hi> Pſal. 105. 45. So God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Covenant engageth to Holineſs, for it is mutual. The end of God's peculiar Chaſtiſements is his peoples Holineſs, <hi>Hebr. 12. 10. God chaſteneth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for our profit: that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> And then the hopes of that peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Glorie we are deſigned to, ſhould engage to Holineſs, 1 <hi>John 3. 3. Every man that hath this hope purifieth himſelf.</hi> The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Sealing of the Spirit tends to this, that we be careful that by ſin we do not <hi>grieve</hi> him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. ſo the end of Communion with God is Holineſs: what elſe makes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints in heaven more holy but this? Thus you ſee, you fruſtrate the end of Mercy, if it doth not make you more holy.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>It is the most ingenuous return of gratitude, which we can make to God for his diſtinguiſhing love.</hi> Sins under mercies, as they have the higheſt guilt, ſo are arguments of the greateſt diſingenuitie. What, <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord?</hi> Deut. 32. 6. Obedience is the beſt thankfulneſs: without which our verbal returns for mercy are but a complement. The thankfulneſs of the life redounds to the honour and praiſe of God in the world: and this God expects from his peculiar people, if you conſult that pregnant Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. Ye are a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57001:117"/> who hath called you,</hi> &amp;c. Otherwiſe God is thus reproached by your ſinfulneſs: "Yonder's a people who boaſt of being God's peculiar; do not you obſerve they live as other men do? they can cheat in their ſhops, diſſemble in their dealings, be frothy and vain in their diſcourſes, live in neglect of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie-duties, as deeply immerſed in the love of the world, as compliant with every fooliſh faſhion, as ambitious of honour, as falſe in their promiſes as others, whom they cenſure as of the world and caſt-awaies. But now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is my Father glorified, if ye bear much fruit,</hi> &amp;c. John 15. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how ſhall I know whether I be one of God's peculiar people,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>purifie</hi> goes before, and <hi>zealous of good works</hi> comes after: ſo that inward Purity, and outward Conformitie, a pure Heart, and a holy Life, are the two ſpecial Evidences of God's peculiar: for they are both the iſſue, and fruits of that faith, whereby we have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>Acts 15. 9. Purifying their hearts by faith;</hi> there is the former; and for the latter, <hi>Gal. 5. 6. Faith works by love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. Then, art thou inwardly purified from ſpiritual pollutions? elſe thou art none of God's peculiar as yet. <hi>Thou becameſt mine,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. What then? <hi>Why then waſhed I thee with water, yea, I throughly waſhed away thy bloud,</hi> verſe 9. Elſe thou art no branch engrafted into Chriſt, for <hi>every branch he purgeth,</hi> John 15. 2.</p>
                  <p>II. Art thou holy in thy <hi>outward converſation?</hi> God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar are an holy people, <hi>Deut. 14. 1, 2. For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people.</hi> To pretend to a peculiarity of intereſt in God, while men willingly continue wallowing in the mire of iniquitie, is a deſperate ſoul-damning preſumption. If you would lay any claim to God's privie-Seal of Election, you muſt bring, and be able to ſhew the broad-Seal of Holineſs. Mark how the Apoſtle joyns theſe together, 2. <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his:</hi> And, <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity:</hi> yea, and follow Holineſs too. The Apoſtle ſpeaks fully, 2 <hi>Corinth. 7. 1. Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57001:117"/> in the fear of God.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Lips. Manud. ad Philoſ.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To queſtion providence,</hi> ver. 11. as if the eye of God could not ſee theſe diſorders in the world, and permit them; ſo lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the faith of the beſt to weakneſs and infirmities: which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> could not conquer, till he went into the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God, and underſtood the miſerable end of wicked men, what-ever ſeeming happineſs they enjoy here, v. 17, and that their <hi>portion</hi> was onely in <hi>this life,</hi> as he ſaith here in the Text; which words may fall under a threefold conſideration.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Upon what accounts it is a miſerable thing to have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I ſhall improve all in ſome ſhort inferences, or brief application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew that wicked men have often the greateſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world: I need not ſpeak much to this, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all ages ſince the beginning of the world confirms it, your own obſervation, I believe, can ſeal to it; how-ever Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture abundantly evinces it. The firſt <hi>murderer</hi> that ever was, carries poſſeſſion in his very name: <hi>Cain</hi> ſignifies ſo much; <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57001:121"/> Go on in the whole ſeries of Scripture, and you ſhall finde <hi>Joſeph</hi> perſecuted by his <hi>brethren; Eſau</hi> (as <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerves on <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.) advanced in the world for a time far above <hi>Jacob;</hi> go on, and you finde the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Gods peculiar in captivitie, and <hi>Pharoah</hi> upon the throne; <hi>Saul</hi> ruling, and <hi>David</hi> in a cave, or in a wilderneſs; <hi>Job</hi> upon the dung-hill; <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the dungeon; <hi>Daniel</hi> in the den, and the <hi>Children</hi> in the furnace, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> on the throne. In the new Teſtament you have <hi>Felix</hi> on the bench, S. <hi>Paul</hi> at the bar; <hi>Dives</hi> in the palace, <hi>Lazarus</hi> at his gates: <hi>Luke 16. 19. he</hi> cloathed in purple, <hi>Lazarus</hi> in rags, and over-ſpread with ſores; <hi>he</hi> banqueted and <hi>fared deliciouſly every day,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> deſired but <hi>the crumbs from the table</hi> and could not have them; <hi>Dives</hi> beſet with his rich and ſtately attendance, <hi>Lazarus</hi> hath no other ſociety but the <hi>Dogs</hi> which came to <hi>lick his ſores, v.</hi> 21. all which <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, lib.</hi> 4. againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> conceive to be a true hiſtorie of what was really acted, though others think it parabolical; <hi>Job</hi> tells us that <hi>the tabernacles of robbers</hi> ſometimes proſper, <hi>Job</hi> 12. 6. which proſperity he at large deſcribes, chap. 21. from v. 7 to v. 14. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in <hi>power,</hi> v. 7. multiplyed in their <hi>poſterity,</hi> v. 8. 11. ſafe at <hi>home,</hi> v. 9. encreaſed <hi>abroad,</hi> v. 10. have their <hi>fill of pleaſure,</hi> v. 12. and <hi>wealth at will,</hi> v. 13. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks his own experience of this, Pſa. 37. 35. Pſa. 73. 7. So in the Text, they enjoy not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours, as aire to breath in, earth to walk on; but the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the world, the riches of nature: their bellies are fill'd with his <hi>hid treaſure,</hi> and that not for themſelves onely, but for their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity too, <hi>they leave the rest of their ſubſtance to their babes,</hi> in a word they <hi>have their portion in this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> But who are theſe wicked men? <hi>Anſ.</hi> In a word, Thoſe who haxe a full affluence of the world and theſe earthly things, and yet are ſuch as the Apoſtle deſcribes <hi>Eph. 2. 12. ſtrangers to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace:</hi> who can ſay that eſtate is mine, and that honour mine, and thoſe lands are mine; but cannot upon any ground ſay, God is mine, Chriſt is mine, the covenant is mine, you have them drawn to the life, Luk. 12. 21. ſuch who have the <hi>world</hi> for a <hi>porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but cannot ſay with David, <hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, They have a <hi>portion</hi> here upon a five-fold account.</p>
                  <p>1. As the iſſue of that univerſal providence, which God exerciſeth in the world, to which every creature owes its being and proviſion; they are cloathed by the ſame hand of univerſal providence, which <hi>arrays the lillies,</hi> nouriſhed by that bountie, which <hi>feeds the ravens,</hi> and ſupplied from that hand, which when God <hi>opens, he filleth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living thing with good.</hi> Pſa. 104. 28. God will look to his whole creation, as a Lord provides for his meaneſt ſlave, though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57001:122"/> him not the inheritance. The whole world lives at Gods charges and allowance, as he is the Soveraign and univerſal Lord; and to the worſt of men, for whom he hath not reſolved and laid out the inheritance of ſons, yet he gives them a <hi>portion here,</hi> as they are creatures. That is the firſt account.</p>
                  <p>2. As the reſult of that patience and long-ſuffering, which God (while he expects their return, and ſolicites their repentance) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth towards the worſt of men: For though God ſometime to demonſtrate the juſt demerit of every ſin, his hatred of it, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt it, and the more effectually to awaken and deter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the imitation of it, ſtrikes a ſinner in the act of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; of which <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> for their <hi>ſacriledge, Corah</hi> and his companie for their <hi>rebellion,</hi> the <hi>children</hi> for <hi>mocking the Prophet,</hi> 2 Kings 2. and <hi>Herod</hi> for his <hi>pride,</hi> Acts 12. are ſad Scripture in ſtances; yet it's the more uſual method of Gods proceedings, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that he <hi>waits to be gracious,</hi> and that <hi>mercy pleaſeth him,</hi> and by his <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> to <hi>lead them to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni non ideo tanti quòd religioſi, ſed quòd impunè ſacrilegi, neque enim potuerunt in ipſis bell is deos adjutores habere, adverſus quos arma rapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt; Arnob. adverſ. Gent. p.</hi> 226. And to ſhew that our ſins wreſt the arrows of his judgements from his hands, he lengthens out his patience to ſinners, during which time he often makes them an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable allowance in the world, the more powerfully by outward favours to win them to himſelf; or if not, to render them the more <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> while by deſpiſing that <hi>patience and goodneſs,</hi> they <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up into themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. As a Judge oft deſigns a fair allowance for a condemned malefactour, while reprieved by his mercy, till the day of execution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that he ſtarve not in priſon. Thus wicked men, though now ſentenced and condemned (for, <hi>he that believes not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18.) God gives them a <hi>portion in this life,</hi> to maintain themſelves till the day of death, and execution by his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>3. As the iſſue of that <hi>univerſal goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercie,</hi> which God demonſtrates to his whole creation: for, <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145. 9. From hence it is that he cauſeth his <hi>ſun to ſhine upon the good and bad,</hi> Matth. 5. 45. And God oft doth wicked men good by theſe <hi>outward bleſsings,</hi> while the enjoyment of them prevents many ſins, which <hi>want</hi> and <hi>povertie</hi> might betray them to: and they, as being of a fordid, baſe, mercenary ſpirit, are oft <hi>bribed</hi> by theſe to give God an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> obſervance, to <hi>abstain</hi> from many ſins, and to <hi>comply</hi> with an <hi>outſide</hi> Religion, for fear of forfeiting their enjoyments by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57001:122"/> judgements of God, or ſome ſtricter Laws of the Land; <hi>&amp; dum fortunam amittere metuunt, nequitiam derelinqunt;</hi> which is the account profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi> gives of Gods providence in this<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bradw. p.</hi> 281</note> particular, that hereby they might be encouraged to a compliance with Religion, if not out of <hi>love,</hi> yet out of <hi>intereſt;</hi> if not for <hi>love</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> yet for <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>loſs</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which is the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary principle of mens Religion; for though <hi>meliores ſunt quos ducit amor,</hi> yet <hi>plures ſunt quos corrigit timor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Austin.</hi> It is more ingenuous to <hi>obey</hi> God out of <hi>love,</hi> but more common to <hi>ſerve</hi> him out of <hi>fear:</hi> thus if nor love to Chriſts <hi>perſon,</hi> nor his <hi>doctrine,</hi> yet deſire of the <hi>loaves</hi> will procure Chriſt many followers. You ſhall oft ſee wicked men complying with Religion outwardly upon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt, and for worldly advantages. As a diſſembling <hi>lover</hi> covets the <hi>portion</hi> more then the <hi>perſon;</hi> ſo do men <hi>court</hi> Religion, to get or keep their portion in this life.</p>
                  <p>4. As the effect and iſſue of Gods <hi>remunerating juſtice.</hi> There is none ſo profligate, or debaucht, but hath ſomething though not of <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> yet of <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>civil</hi> goodneſs, as rewards to which God lays them out a portion here, to demonſtrate that love God bears to all goodneſs where-ever he finde it. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crital <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>faſtings</hi> have their <hi>reward</hi> here, Mat. 6. 5. <hi>Ahabs</hi> counterfeit humiliation protracts the threatned judgement, 1 Kings 21. 29. <hi>Iehu's</hi> falſe <hi>zeal</hi> is recompenced with a kingdome for four generations, 2 Kings 10. 30. So <hi>Ezekiel 29. 18, 19, 20.

                  <p>5. As the means of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual advantage</hi> to Gods own
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57001:123"/> people, which next to his own <hi>glory</hi> God deſigns as the end of all his <hi>providential</hi> diſpenſations in the world. They are all for the triall, inſtruction, exerciſe, and comfort of Gods people; ſo is this particular <hi>providence</hi> of God, in diſtributing to wicked men a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it is a juſt encouragement to them to go on cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the ways of God upon an aſſurance of a better portion in another life; which <hi>David</hi> ſeems here to reſpect v. 15. as if he had ſaid, <hi>If they have their portion here, I ſhall certainly have it hereafter, when I ſhall behold the face of God in righteouſneſs.</hi> And certainly, if God rewards the ſhews of goodneſs in wicked men with a portion in this life; ſhall he not reward thy <hi>real</hi> holineſs with glory in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life? if thoſe who are prodigalls, who run away from God, have the <hi>huskes</hi> to fill them; ſhalt not thou have <hi>bread</hi> in thy fathers houſe? If <hi>Jehu's</hi> zeal, Ahab's humiliation, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> prayer and faſting, though all but counterfeit, go not without their reward in this life; ſhall thy <hi>true zeal</hi> for God, <hi>heartie repentance</hi> for ſin, <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer</hi> for mercy not be rewarded hereafter? Look as thoſe afflictions, which the Saints ſuffer here, are ſure and ſad arguments of that eternal wrath and deſtruction, which the juſtice of God ſhall deal out to wicked ungodly men hereafter, as the Apoſtle evidently argues, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7.

                     <hi>quàm ſi illa ad turpiſsimos defert, ab optimis abigit,</hi> ſaith the heathen <hi>Seneca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This providence of God may moſt powerfully work in us a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to theſe earthly enjoyments. How ſhould this pull down the towering and ambitious thoughts of men; to conſider that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>Neroes,</hi> ungodly <hi>Caligulaes,</hi> apoſtate <hi>Julians,</hi> have oft their <hi>crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters?</hi> How ſhould this take of all immoderate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous cares for the world, to conſider that the fool in the Goſpel had his <hi>full barns?</hi> And this ſhould teach Chriſtians to abhor that fooliſh affectation of <hi>delicious fare,</hi> and <hi>coſtly arrayment,</hi> to thinke that <hi>Dives,</hi> now roaring in hell, in his life time enjoyed both theſe in abundance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is an occaſional means of trying his peoples grace, and heightning their glory. <hi>Datur occaſio majoris meriti &amp; coronae,</hi> is the account <hi>Leſsius,</hi> in his tract <hi>de providentia numinis,</hi> gives of this Providence of God. Had no <hi>perſecùters,</hi> no <hi>Neroes,</hi> no <hi>Caligulaes</hi> ever flouriſhed, the glory of the Martyrs <hi>patience, faith,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy</hi> had been obſcured. As <hi>Jacob</hi> diſcovered the ſincerity of his affection to <hi>Rachel,</hi> that he <hi>continued</hi> to love her, notwithſtanding all the <hi>hard uſage</hi> he endured for her ſake: thus the luſter of the Saints <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>humilitie</hi> ſhines through thoſe reproaches and ſcandals, which the world caſts upon them; they are all but <hi>foyles</hi> to ſet of the beautie and glory of Chriſtians graces. The portions of wicked men in this life, are eſpecially <hi>tryals</hi> of the ſincerity of a Chriſtians <hi>affection</hi> to God, and <hi>love</hi> to holineſs; whoſe ſoul can burn in a <hi>holy flame</hi> of divine love, though not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57001:124"/> nor cheriſhed by the <hi>fewel</hi> of outward <hi>proſperitie.</hi> That is the <hi>hotteſt</hi> flame, which is encreaſed by its contrary cold; thus is the flame of true love augmented by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. It is a kinde of ſpiritual <hi>ſimonie,</hi> not love, which muſt be <hi>bribed</hi> by theſe outward enjoyments. And as this tries their grace, ſo it adds to their glory: <hi>Quantò plus tormenti, tantò plus erit gloriae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> The perſecutions of the Heathen Emperours added new <hi>pearls</hi> to the Martyrs <hi>crowns:</hi> and the Apoſtle aſſures us, that the <hi>light afflictions</hi> which the Saints ſuffer here, (whileſt wicked men oft flouriſh) do <hi>work</hi> out for them <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wherein lies the miſery of that man who hath his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely in this life. It appears miſerable from Scripture; Luke 6. 24. <hi>But wo unto you that are rich; for you have received your conſolation.</hi> So, <hi>Wo unto them that are at eaſe in Zion, &amp;c. Amos</hi> 6. 1. and ſo it muſt needs be upon a ſix-fold account.</p>
                  <p>I. Becauſe he hath no <hi>real ſatisfaction</hi> in this portion, as to his <hi>better part.</hi> He vexeth and diſquieteth himſelf to get and preſerve his portion, and when he hath done all, he <hi>graſps the winde,</hi> and <hi>courts vanity:</hi> he is filled with nothing but emptineſs: <hi>he ſhall not feel quietneſs,</hi> Job 20. 22. And being <hi>without God,</hi> who is the onely <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>centre</hi> of ſouls, he is as far from <hi>true ſatisfaction,</hi> as from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al happineſs.</hi> The Goſpel brands him for a <hi>fool,</hi> who dream'd of a <hi>requiem</hi> to his ſoul from his <hi>full barns,</hi> Luke 12. 20. Where there is <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> there muſt be <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> and <hi>proportion;</hi> and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be between the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>ſoul:</hi> therefore <hi>diſ ſatisfaction</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon the fulleſt enjoyments of the world, if you believe <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, He that loveth ſilver ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver, nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe: this is alſo vanitie,</hi> Eccles. 5. 10. Now I appeal to you, how ſad is it for men to have ſouls made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God, and <hi>happineſs</hi> in eternity, and yet to enjoy nothing but a <hi>diſ-ſatisfying</hi> portion in this ſhort and vain life. Methinks, the ſoul of man is like <hi>Noahs</hi> dove: a <hi>wicked</hi> mans ſoul is like the dove <hi>out</hi> of the Ark in a conſtant motion and ever reſtleſs; but a <hi>pious</hi> ſoul is like the dove <hi>returned</hi> to the Ark, taking up its reſt in God. And herein is the excellencie of a Chriſtians portion, though he hath nothing in the world, that whereas the greateſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked worldling brings himin nothing but <hi>vanity &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation,</hi> a Chriſtian inherits <hi>full ſatisfaction</hi> in his portion, as <hi>David</hi> adds ver. 15. <hi>I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs:</hi> there's his, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtians portion, viz. <hi>the enjoyment of God.</hi> and then ſee the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> entayled upon this portion, <hi>When I awake</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:57001:124"/>
                  <p>II. Becauſe he enjoyes it without the <hi>love</hi> of God. His portion argues not the truth of Gods love to his perſon; for being out of Chriſt, God accepts him not: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6. it is in the <hi>beloved</hi> onely that our perſons are <hi>accepted:</hi> nor doth it ſpeak Gods approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wayes, the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> of his nature permits not that. What comfort is it to enjoy the world with the <hi>frowns</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God? what comfort in <hi>corn,</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>oyl,</hi> without the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> Pſal. 4. 7. The ſence of the love of God ſweetens the leaſt enjoyment and portion in the world: <hi>pulſe</hi> and <hi>water</hi> are <hi>delicious fare</hi> with theſe. <hi>Thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better then life,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. <hi>Life</hi> is the <hi>coupler</hi> and <hi>cement</hi> of all our earthly portions; <hi>all</hi> is gone, if <hi>life</hi> be gone: it is the love of God that <hi>ſweetens</hi> that. The greateſt portion in the world muſt needs be uncomfortable without this. For a man to have <hi>enlarged</hi> and <hi>full barns,</hi> and with all to have an angry God ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning him with a <hi>Stulte hâc nocte,</hi> how terrible is it and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable? Yet this is the caſe of all thoſe who have their portions onely in this life.</p>
                  <p>III. Becauſe he enjoys it without intereſt in Chriſt: through whom onely it is that our earthly portions become true <hi>comforts</hi> and <hi>real bleſsings, He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. Then they are bleſſings indeed, when they are given us together with Chriſt; and thus Chriſtians enjoy their earthly portions, as appurtenances to Chriſt, as entails upon the Covenant, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as an <hi>acceſsion</hi> or <hi>over-plus,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> comments on <hi>Matth,</hi> 6. 33 <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>you,</hi> who ſeek <hi>firſt the kingdom of heaven,</hi> who have an intereſt in Chriſt. How uncomfortable is it to enjoy a portion here, without a part and portion in Chriſt? look, as intereſt in Chriſt ſweetens the worſt croſſes and afflictions of a Chriſtian, (Chriſt being as the <hi>tree</hi> was to the <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>Marah,</hi> Exod. 15. 25. he removes the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of afflictions; or as the <hi>honey</hi> in the belly of the <hi>lyon,</hi> Judges 14. <hi>ſweetning</hi> the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring affliction): ſo the greateſt portion of the world without Chriſt is a real curſe to a wicked man, who (I do not ſay they have no juſt right or title to their portions here: for to found Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in grace, is to leave the world to very uncertain <hi>Owners,</hi> and is the principle of oppreſſion and confuſion) enjoys no portion in a comfortable manner. Chriſt is the conveyance even of temporal bleſſings, when enjoy'd in a ſanctified manner, <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts,</hi> with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 23. And, truely, to enjoy all things without Chriſt, is nothing; it is to enjoy the <hi>husk</hi> without the <hi>grain;</hi> the <hi>ſhell</hi> without the <hi>kernel;</hi> the <hi>bone</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:57001:125"/> without the <hi>marrow;</hi> the <hi>casket</hi> without the <hi>jewel;</hi> the <hi>field</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>pearl;</hi> and thus do all wicked men enjoy their portions in this life, who, as the Apoſtle deſcribes them, are <hi>without God and Christ in the world,</hi> Eph. 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>IV. Becauſe he enjoys no <hi>true real comfort</hi> in his portion in this life. Some counterfeit contentment, and ſeeming forced joy and delight he may have in his earthly enjoyments: but we may truely ſay, as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth, <hi>Eccleſ. 2. 2. What doth it?</hi> it profits nothing; this comfort is neither true, nor laſting.</p>
                  <p>And that,</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe of the <hi>mixture</hi> of ſome <hi>croſſes,</hi> and many <hi>cares,</hi> which wound and peirce the ſoul <hi>through with many ſorrows,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aſſures us, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 10. Vexation of ſpirit</hi> is entail'd inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon this earthly portion: <hi>Vexation</hi> in the procuring of it, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 2. 22, 23. What diſquieting <hi>plottings</hi> and <hi>contrivances</hi> to get this portion? and when he hath it, how diſquieted is he, &amp; diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and divided between <hi>care</hi> to keep, and enlarge it, and <hi>fear</hi> to looſe it? beſides, how oft doth ſome outward croſs embitter his portion. As the Saints in their greateſt afflictions have their <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida intervalla,</hi> comfortable refreſhings, intervals of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, (<hi>Prov. 10. 22. The bleſsing of the Lord it maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it</hi>): So he that enjoys the moſt full portion in this life, meets oft with that croſs, which robs him of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his enjoyments; as the <hi>rich man's</hi> ſummons, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. dampt his joy in his <hi>full barns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe of the <hi>ſting of conſcience:</hi> which if once awakened, gnaws, and ſecretly eats out all the comfort of his earthly portion, whoſe ſecret ſuggeſtions and whiſperings in the fulleſt enjoyments, oft ſurprizeth, and fills the ſoul with ſadneſs and horrour. The <hi>hand-writing</hi> againſt <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> makes him <hi>tremble</hi> amidſt all his <hi>carouzes</hi> in <hi>the cups of the Temple,</hi> Dan. 5. 5, 6. <hi>Judas</hi> threw away the <hi>thirtie pieces,</hi> Matth. 27. 5. no comfort in them when ſummoned to the <hi>tribunal</hi> of conſcience as guiltie of the bloud of Chriſt. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos fortuna liberat poenâ, metu neminem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> What <hi>Tacitus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Senec. ep. 98. Tacit. Annal. lib.</hi> 6.</note> ſaith of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> is true of all wicked men, <hi>Si recludantur mentes, poſſe aſpici laniatus &amp; ictus.</hi> Though God reprieves wicked men from preſent execution, yet they are oft diſquieted with inward fear: this <hi>vultur</hi> at the heart preys upon their inward comfort, and thus <hi>in the midſt of laughter the heart is ſorrowfull,</hi> Prov. 14. 13. and the greateſt portion in the world is no more ſolace or comfort, then a velvet ſlipper to a goutie foot, or a crown to an aking head.</p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe of the <hi>ſecret curſe of God,</hi> which is entailed upon a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57001:125"/> wicked mans portion in this life; what ever he enjoys he hath the <hi>curſe of God</hi> going along with it; hath he a fair eſtate? that is a curſe to him, <hi>Deut. 28. 17, 18. Curſed ſhall be thy basket and thy ſtore. Curſed ſhall be the fruit of thy land, the encreaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep.</hi> Hath he plentifull and delicious fare and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? this is accurſed too, <hi>Job 20. 23. When he is about to fill his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God ſhall caſt the furie of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain it upon him while he is eating:</hi> This curſe appears ſometime in the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble waſting, and decay of his portion; that the rich worldling puts money into a bagge with <hi>holes,</hi> Hagg. 1. 6. and it runs out he knows not how: ſometimes by blaſting their comfort in them, ſtopping them in their moſt eager carrier, and hotteſt purſuit of the world; and when they have riches, they have no heart to uſe them, which <hi>Solomon</hi> takes notice of as the greateſt vanity of the world, <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 2. It is the bleſsing of the Lord that maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. From this it was that <hi>Daniel's</hi> countenance, after ten daies living with <hi>pulſe and water,</hi> look't <hi>fairer and fatter,</hi> then thoſe who eat the portion of <hi>the kings meat,</hi> Dan. 1. 15. So on the contrarie it is the ſecret <hi>curſe of God</hi> which blaſts a wicked mans portion in the world; we read <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. of <hi>two goats,</hi> the <hi>goat for the ſin offering,</hi> and <hi>the ſcape-goat;</hi> the firſt ſacrificed to God, the other diſmiſſed into <hi>the wilderneſs</hi> with all the ſins and curſes of the children of Iſrael upon his head: <hi>Origen,</hi> after his uſual manner, allegorizing on that<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Orig. Hom.</hi> 9.</note> place, makes theſe <hi>two goates</hi> repreſentations of <hi>good and wicked men:</hi> the godly, being oft <hi>ſors Domini,</hi> are <hi>martyred and perſecuted,</hi> but by it they are made <hi>an acceptable ſacrifice to God;</hi> the wicked <hi>(qui ſunt de hoc mundo) the men of the world,</hi> are ſet at libertie, have their freedom, and enjoy enlargement <hi>in the wilderneſs of the world,</hi> but laded with their own ſins, and the curſes of God upon their heads. And how miſerable is this for the Iſraelites <hi>to have Quails,</hi> and the <hi>wrath of God</hi> overtaking them, while they were eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 32. for men to have their tables richly ſpread with dainties, and that <hi>table to become a ſnare to them,</hi> muſt needs be<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 22.</note> miſerable: and yet thus it is with all thoſe who have their portions onely in this life.</p>
                  <p>V. Becauſe he enjoys it to his <hi>real hurt and miſchief.</hi> It was that ſore evil which <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved <hi>under the ſun,</hi> that <hi>riches were kept for the owners thereof to their hurt,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 13: <hi>Periculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſsima eſt felicitatis intemperantia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca. Dives eſt aliquis malus? habet ſibi in curam, angorem, ruinam,</hi> ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. Wealth is the worldlings vexation here, and ruine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>A wicked mans portion in the world tends to his miſchief four waies.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:57001:126"/>
                  <p>1. <hi>As it eſtranges him from God.</hi> We read of the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. that when he had got his portion, he ran away from his father into a <hi>far countrie,</hi> and ſpent it in <hi>riotous living,</hi> v. 12, 13. ſo doth the portion of wicked men here ſet them at a diſtance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to God; and truely nothing ſooner alienates mens ſouls from God and goodneſs, then a great portion in the world. The devil offered this as a ſuitable temptation to prevail with Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth. 4. 9. All theſe things,</hi> &amp;c. He hath kept this as his reſerve, as his laſt temptation; if this will not do, he knew his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſaults would be to little purpoſe. It was a ſeaſonable admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave to Iſrael, <hi>Deut. 8. 10, 11, When thou hast eaten, and art full, then thou ſhalt bleſs the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee,</hi> &amp;c. there was great danger that the milk and honey of <hi>Canaan</hi> might make them forget God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Deut 6. 12. Beware, leſt thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the houſe of bondage.</hi> And this is none of the leaſt miſchiefs of that portion wicked men have in this life.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>As it betraies them, and laies them open to abundance of ſin:</hi> their worldly abundance is but <hi>fewel</hi> to their <hi>luſt, exalts them in pride,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 5, 6. As <hi>Alexander's</hi> victories cauſed him to ſubſcribe himſelf, <hi>The ſon of Jupiter;</hi> it heightens them into contempt and forgetfulneſs of God, <hi>According to their paſture, ſo were they filled: they were filled, and their heart was exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: therefore have they forgotten me,</hi> Hoſea 13. 6. It oft makes them more hardned at heart, and reſolved in ſin; &amp; with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Exod. 5. 2. It makes them unfruitfull under the means of grace, as <hi>Luke 8. 14. the ſeed that fell among thorns</hi> is expounded of them that are <hi>choaked</hi> with <hi>cares, and riches, and pleaſures of this life.</hi> It betraies them to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as you may ſee it did <hi>Sodom,</hi> Ezek. 16. 49. Common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells us that is the mother, and nurſe of all impietie; God knowing this, oft (as a wiſe Phyſitian opens a vein to prevent a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe) cuts ſhort his own people as to their portion in this world, lets them bloud in their eſtates and honours, to prevent in them thoſe ſins, which the wicked mans abundance ſolicites and betrays him to.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>As it imbitters every affliction, and makes death more terrible</hi> O death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee, to a man that lives at reſt in his poſſeſſions? to a man that hath nothing to vex him, &amp; hath proſperitie in all things? <hi>O death, acceptable is thy ſentence to the needy,</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 4. 1, 2. which place though I dare not adopt into Scripture, yet I dare take it for a certain truth. <hi>Affliction</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57001:126"/> him, and <hi>death</hi> terrifies him; he is building <hi>Tabernacles</hi> here, and enlarging his barns, and hugging his preſent enjoyments in this life, <hi>quam ſolùm ſuam vitam putant, qui aeternam deſperant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Augustine</hi> upon my Text. And, truely, they muſt needs tremble to part with their portion in this life, who deſpair of getting any porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in another.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>As it encreaſeth his wo, and undoes his ſoul to eternitie. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of fools ſhall destroy them,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi> Prov. 1. 32. The abuſe of his <hi>earthly portion</hi> will render him the more inexcuſable<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> at the laſt day: and how ſad is it to <hi>treaſure up the world,</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> together? As it is comfortable for Chriſtians to conſider that all their afflictions here will encreaſe their future glory, when every tear they have here wept ſhall turn into a pearl to beautifie and enrich their crown: ſo it is miſerable to think how the wicked mans preſent proſperitie ſhall afterward encreaſe his miſery. That's a terrible place, <hi>Revel. 18. 7. How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her:</hi> the very remembrance of which will be part of hell to him. How will that ſtrike him to the very heart, <hi>Luke 16. 25. Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> &amp;c? and that's the laſt account I ſhall give you of this mans miſerie, who hath his portion onely here.</p>
                  <p>VI. Conſider <hi>the miſerable portion ſuch a man ſhall have in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other life</hi> which Scripture acquaints us with, <hi>Pſal. 11. 6. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempeſt: this ſhall be the portion of their cup:</hi> and 'tis <hi>parabolically</hi> expreſſed in <hi>Mat. 24. 51.

Then ſhall an unjuſt <hi>Felix</hi> curſe his bribes, and oppreſſours their extortion, covetous worldlings their uſurie, and cunning Merchants their gains, their cheats and over-reaches in trading. And, how miſerable do you conceive their caſe to be? when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>Dives,</hi> who here is arrayed in purple and ſilk, ſhall there lye down clothed and enwrapped in flames: when many who here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the ſtatelieſt palaces, ſhall there dwell with <hi>everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> Iſa. 33. 14. when many who here fare deliciouſly every day, ſhall then with <hi>Dives</hi> call for, and that in vain too, <hi>a drop of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Luke 16. 24. when many who here <hi>chaunt to the ſound of the

This miſerable portion of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men is that which Scripture oft ſuggeſts to us, as the account of God's providence in dealing them out a portion of the world here, and as a means of conquering all diſtruſtfull repinings: to this <hi>Job</hi> refers us, chap. 21. 30. <hi>The wicked is reſerved to the day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: they ſhall be brought forth to the day of wrath:</hi> and <hi>David Pſal. 37. 35, 36. I have ſeen the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelf like a green bay-tree: yet he paſſed away, and lo, he was not: yea, I ſought him, but he could not be found. David</hi> overcame his temptation, when he went into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and underſtood the end of theſe men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 17. that God had ſet them in <hi>ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie places,</hi> and ſo being the higher, they were in danger of the greater fall, <hi>verſe</hi> 18, 19. and that their preſent happineſs was but as a dream, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. ſhort and deceitfull. Give me leave to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that place, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 48. 13, 14. when <hi>Jacob</hi> was to bleſs <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſons, <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſet <hi>Ephraim</hi> on his <hi>left</hi> hand, and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> on the <hi>right;</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi> on the contrary laid his <hi>right</hi> hand on <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and his <hi>left</hi> on <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> many who are here ſet on the <hi>right</hi> hand of the <hi>world,</hi> enriched with the greateſt bleſſings it can afford, ſhall at the laſt day be ſet on Gods <hi>left</hi> hand, and be diſpatched with that ſentence; <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> Matth. 25. 41. and thoſe whom the world ſets on her <hi>left,</hi> as ſcorned and contemned, ſhall be found amongſt thoſe on Gods <hi>right</hi> hand, who ſhall receive the <hi>bleſsing,</hi> and the <hi>kingdome of their Father,</hi> verſ. 34.

                  <p>Secondly, Let Chriſtians learn hence <hi>to live by faith.</hi> This is one end of Gods dealing out a <hi>large portion</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> to wicked men, while his own people are <hi>in want</hi> and <hi>afflicted,</hi> to teach them to wait by faith and in dependance upon God for that portion he hath treaſured up for them in heaven.

Thus doth God, the great Lord of all, deal with his <hi>ſlaves,</hi> who ſerve him for the <hi>hire</hi> of ſome <hi>temporal</hi> advantage, he gives them their <hi>preſent reward,</hi> and <hi>wages;</hi> but though his goodneſs hath determined a better portion to be a reward to the <hi>pietie</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> of his <hi>children;</hi> yet he gives it them <hi>in reverſion,</hi> little <hi>in hand,</hi> that they may learn to live upon the <hi>promiſe,</hi> and by faith to depend on the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of their Father for their heavenly inheritance; that they walking not by <hi>ſight,</hi> but <hi>faith</hi> (which is a Chriſtians work and condition here) may not <hi>look at the things which are ſeen, &amp;c,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 18.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Hence, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> learn <hi>ſubmiſsion under the loſſes, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under the croſſes</hi> of this world. <hi>Juſtis quidquid malorum ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis dominis irrogatur, non eſt paena criminis, ſed virtutis examen,</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, This regulates our judgements concerning <hi>true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> we are very apt to miſtake here. As <hi>Samuel</hi> viewing the <hi>beautie</hi> and <hi>stature</hi> of <hi>Eliab,</hi> would have him <hi>annointed</hi> and the <hi>crown</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 6, 12.</note> ſet on his head; when yet God had deſign'd the kingdome for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> at the <hi>ſheep-fold:</hi> thus are men apt to ſet the <hi>crown</hi> of happineſs on thoſe, who are moſt <hi>enriched,</hi> and highlyeſt <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:57001:129"/> in the world, and think thoſe the onely happy men: when yet in truth, if wicked men, they are moſt miſerable, as having their portion onely in <hi>this life.</hi> Therefore <hi>David</hi> ſeems to correct his judgement of happineſs, Pſal. 144. 15. <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, This may inſtruct our <hi>charity,</hi> and teach us to do <hi>good</hi> to our very enemies: it is but to write after Gods own <hi>copy,</hi> who oft gives the worſt of his enemies a <hi>portion</hi> and <hi>Almes</hi> here: and our Saviour urgeth this as a <hi>motive</hi> and <hi>incentive</hi> to our charitie, and a <hi>pattern</hi> for our imitation, Matthew 5. 44, 45. <hi>I ſay unto you love your enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Eighthly, This diſcovers that <hi>rotten foundation,</hi> upon which many men build their <hi>hopes</hi> of heaven. <hi>Surely.</hi> (are many ready to argue) <hi>if God did not love me, he would not give me ſuch a portion in the world:</hi> deceive not thy ſelf in a matter of ſo great concernment, Thou maiſt as well ſay <hi>God loved Judas, becauſe he had the bags,</hi> or <hi>Div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Let this awaken us all to a <hi>ſerious tryall</hi> and <hi>examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our ſelves this day, whether we be of the number of thoſe who have their portion onely in <hi>this life:</hi> the greateſt part of the world are of this ſort.

                  <p>I. How cam'ſt thou by that portion in the world which thou haſt? or, How haſt thou encreaſed it? Art thou exalted upon the <hi>ruins</hi> of others?

I muſt take the boldneſs to ſay as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David; Thou art the man:</hi> without <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>reſtitution,</hi> (and truly the firſt will be but counterfeit and hypocritical without the other; we read <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> Luke 19. reſtored <hi>four-ſold</hi>) thou art the man that haſt thy portion onely <hi>in this life.

                  <p>II. <hi>Examine thy affections.</hi> After what doth the violence of thy <hi>deſires</hi> run? upon what is thy <hi>delight</hi> fixt? what <hi>ſads</hi> and <hi>diſquiets</hi> thy ſoul moſt at the loſs of it? what-ever that is <hi>that</hi> is thy portion.

God was <hi>Davids</hi> portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57. how did <hi>David</hi> diſcover this? by his <hi>longing</hi> and <hi>breathing after him,</hi> Pſal. 42. 1. above what ever was either in <hi>heaven</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi> Pſal. 73. 25. by his <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>rejoycing in him;</hi> all the encreaſe of <hi>corn</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>oyl</hi> could not fill <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul with ſo much gladneſs, as one <hi>glimpſe of the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> Pſal. 4. 7. and nothing filled his ſoul with ſo much ſorrow, as the <hi>loſs</hi> and <hi>with-drawings</hi> of God, Pſal. 42. 4. and, <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious, and ſhut up his loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure?</hi> Pſal. 77. 7, 8, 9. But now you ſhall ſee quite contrary affections in that worldling, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 18, 19. his plottings are how to <hi>enlarge his barns,</hi> his ſouls <hi>requiem, joy,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> is taken up in theſe <hi>worldly enjoyments. Ahab</hi> is <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> and <hi>ſad,</hi> if he cannot have <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths vineyard, 1 Kings 21. 4. Haman</hi> is <hi>enraged</hi> for want of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai's</hi> bowed knee, <hi>Eſther 3. 5. Portio cujusque dicitur, in quo felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem ſuam quisque locat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin:</hi> and do not moſt mens <hi>cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-care</hi> for the <hi>procuring</hi> innordinate delight in the enjoying, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull fear</hi> of <hi>looſing,</hi> and <hi>repining ſorrows</hi> for <hi>parting</hi> with the world, ſpeak that it is their <hi>portion,</hi> and their <hi>happineſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. What <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>improvement</hi> do you make of your <hi>earthly enjoyments?</hi> are they <hi>cords of love</hi> to God? <hi>engagements to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? encouragements</hi> and <hi>enablements</hi> to do God more ſervice? Doeſt thou rejoyce in them as giving <hi>opportunities</hi> to do more good to others? Canſt thou ſay they are <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> with thee to walk <hi>chearfully</hi> vvith God? They are thy <hi>viaticum</hi> to a better inheritance; but if thou uſeſt, or rather abuſeſt, thy <hi>riches</hi> to <hi>luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>riot,</hi> thy <hi>power</hi> to <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppreſsion,</hi> thy <hi>beauty</hi> as a <hi>bait</hi> to <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> thy <hi>learning</hi> in patronage of <hi>errour</hi> and oppoſing the truths of God? If thy <hi>worldly enjoyments</hi> draws thee from thy <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to God; as <hi>fat pastures</hi> make beaſts more <hi>unruly?</hi> If with <hi>Jeſhurun, Deut.</hi> 32. 15. thou <hi>waxeſt fat,</hi> and <hi>kickeſt</hi> againſt God; ſadly think of it, without repentance thou art the man, who haſt thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely in <hi>this life.</hi> The ſum then is, whoever <hi>gets</hi> his earthly porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57001:130"/> 
                     <hi>unjuſtly, affects</hi> it <hi>inordinately, uſeth</hi> it <hi>unfruitfully</hi> and <hi>ungodlily,</hi> he is the man, whoſe miſery it is to have his portion in <hi>this life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>Chriſtians, prize your portion.</hi> Though you have little or no portion in the world, there is an excellency in a Chriſtians portion above what is to be found in the largeſt portions of the world, which wicked men enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Let us all ſeriouſly ſet upon it this day, to <hi>treaſure up a portion to our ſelves in another life:</hi> to take our Saviours advice, Matth. 6. 20. to <hi>lay up for our ſelves treaſures in heaven.</hi> To you eſpecially I ſpeak, who have the largeſt portion in this world: none ſo apt to neglect the thoughts and care of heaven, as thoſe who have moſt upon earth, as being immers'd in <hi>worldly pleaſures,</hi> and on every hand beſet with <hi>temptations to ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſolicitations</hi> to <hi>forget God. Luther</hi> was wont to reſolve, <hi>ſe nolle ſic ſatiari,</hi> that <hi>God ſhould not put him off with an earthly portion.</hi> That you may get a portion hereafter, take theſe directions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Make it your first and chief buſineſs to lay up a portion in heaven.</hi> 'Tis the moſt compendious way to get a portion in the world, Matth. 6. 33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdome of God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> You will be every way gainers by it even in this life; <hi>for all theſe things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> caſt in as an <hi>addition</hi> and <hi>over-plus, (Solomon</hi> had <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> caſt in as an <hi>additional over-plus</hi> to that <hi>wiſdome</hi> he asked of God) or elſe the <hi>ſanctified uſe</hi> of thy little portion in this life, and, as in <hi>Prov. 15. 16, Better is little with the fear of the Lord, then great treaſure and trouble therewith:</hi> and <hi>Prov. 16. 19. Better it is to be of an humble ſpirit with the lowly, then to divide the ſpoil with the proud.</hi> Thou ſhalt have the world ſo far as it is good for thee, and that little thou haſt ſhall be filled up with the <hi>bleſsings</hi> of God <hi>here;</hi> and in the <hi>other life</hi> too: <hi>Godlineſs</hi> hath the promiſe of both: 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:</hi> of the one <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and the other <hi>conditionally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Live ſuitably to the nature and expectations of a portion in another life,</hi> that is, <hi>holily: without this holineſs no man ſhall ever ſee the face of God,</hi> Hebr. 12. 14. and that's the portion of <hi>Saints</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as appears verſ. 15. after my Text, <hi>David</hi> oppoſing this to that portion the men of the world have in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Get a portion of grace here treaſured up in your hearts:</hi> Pſal. 84. 11. <hi>The Lord God is a ſun and ſhield, the Lord will give grace and glorie:</hi> not one without the other, all the <hi>glory</hi> in the world without <hi>grace</hi> will not entitle us to <hi>glory</hi> hereafter: Let us then labour to make ſure of God as our <hi>portion</hi> in <hi>this life,</hi> that in <hi>another life</hi> he may be our <hi>exceeding great reward.</hi>

                  <p>III. The abrogation of the Jewiſh worſhip, and Levitical ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.

                  <p>IV. The <hi>heathen Oracles are ſilenced,</hi> and their <hi>idolatrie deſtroyed;</hi> which was to be at the coming of the Meſſiah, according to the propheſie of <hi>Zechariah, And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land,

                     </note> Teſtament concerning the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> He was to be <hi>born of a virgin,</hi> Iſa. 7. 14. <hi>Behold a virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son:</hi> ſo was our Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 23. And that too in the citie of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> Mich. 2. 2. <hi>But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Iſrael:</hi> and ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 11. brought up too in <hi>Galilee,</hi> Matth. 2. 22. and he rode in <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into Jeruſalem,</hi> Matth. 21. as it was propheſied of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> Zech. 9. 9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly, O daughter of Zion, ſhout, O daughter of Jeruſalem, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. There is not a paſſage in the death of Chriſt, but was in anſwer to ſome propheſies of the old Teſtament, his <hi>ſide pierced,</hi> as foretold by <hi>Zechariah, They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. his <hi>drinking of vinegar,</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 69. 21.

By the harmony of which events to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were convinced to leave their <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Doctrine and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: witneſs <hi>whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> whoſe converſion from a ſetled, inveterate Idolatrie, in a ſhort time, without worldly power and force; no enticements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit; no carnal means; in the face of fire and faggot,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57001:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> brought over to the acknowledgement of a <hi>crucified Meſsiah,</hi> muſt needs ſpeak God in it, and muſt certainly be imputed to the care of God in fulfilling thoſe propheſies, which he that runs may read concerning the <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>coming in</hi> of the Gentiles at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> ſee <hi>Iſaiah 2. 2, 3.

In reference to the fulfilling which propheſies Chriſt bad <hi>John's</hi> diſciples tell him, as an argument that Chriſt was he which ſhould come; that the <hi>blinds received their ſight,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 11. 5. It was a rational concluſion which they made, <hi>John,</hi> 6. 14. when they had ſeen the miracle of the multiplied loaves, <hi>This is of a truth that Prophet that ſhould come into the world:</hi>

And far be that blaſphemie from the thoughts of any of our hearts, that theſe were done by Magick, or the power of the devil; why did not his enemies accuſe him of it? eſpecially when it was one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the judges of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that they ſhould be <hi>skill'd in</hi>

For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then others, who envied Chriſt the glorie that he got by theſe miracles, would out of envy and emulation have learnt the ſame art, which yet no hiſtory makes mention of, that ever I ſaw, or heard of.

The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee.</hi> Nor yet muſt we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it as by any change of place: but either becauſe his <hi>humane nature</hi> was produced not by any <hi>earthly generation,</hi> but by a <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner,</hi> or becauſe of Chriſts willing ſubmiſſion, and humbling himſelf to take this nature upon him, and to <hi>appear in the form of a ſervant,</hi> as he is ſaid to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p>II. Not a <hi>real parting</hi> with any of his <hi>glory:</hi> for that being <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> as he was God, was as incapable of any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, as of any acceſſion: even then when he came into the world, and <hi>took upon him the form of a ſervant, he counted it not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, Phil.</hi> 2. 6. Indeed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. he <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf</hi> as to his Divine nature, not abſolutely confidered in it ſelf, but in reſpect of that voluntary <hi>aeconomy</hi> and diſpenſation, whereby he condeſcended to take upon him our nature, and <hi>the form of a ſervant;</hi> but even then, when he was come <hi>into the fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtle tells you, he was <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Achilde born,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. yet the <hi>mighty</hi> God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. noting his being before born, in thoſe words, <hi>whoſe going forth have been of old, from everlaſting.</hi> But this phraſe ſpeaks five things.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>The pre-exiſtence of the Divine nature: viz.</hi> that Chriſt <hi>was</hi> before he <hi>came</hi> into the world. This is alſo hinted in other like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture; as, firſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. which ſpeaks that he had an <hi>exiſtence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came into the world. ſee 1 <hi>John 3. 8. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted,</hi> and to name no more, 1 <hi>John 4. 23. Hereby know ye the ſpirit of God: every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hinc colligimus priùs fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe apud patrem, quò ostenditur coaeterna ejus Divinitas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this place. The Socinians uſe many ſhifts to evade this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Chriſt's Divinitie, as that to <hi>come in the fleſh is to appear in infirmitie, miſery, and contempt:</hi> but though <hi>fleſh</hi> in Scripture ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſometimes weakneſs; yet <hi>to come in the fleſh,</hi> is never ſo uſed. Beſides, the Apoſtle makes this an evidence of believers, <hi>to confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh:</hi> many unbelievers ſaw and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he lived without pomp, and worldly Majeſty, in poverty and infirmity. See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 2, 3. A ſecond like expreſſion in Scripture is, that <hi>God and man came to ſave ſinners,</hi> which is from God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Antichrist</hi> is ſaid <hi>to come,</hi> 1 John 2. 18. and yet he doth not therefore <hi>exist before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A lamentable ſhift, for Scripture muſt give light to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57001:135"/> as the Lamps in the Tabernacle were to be lighted by one another, according to the Law. Our faith muſt be built upon the Analogie of Scripture, which in many parallel expreſſions ſpeaks<note place="margin">Analogy and Parallel.</note> this truth: as <hi>Hebrews 2. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, He took on him,</hi> which muſt neceſſarily include the <hi>pre-exiſtence</hi> of that nature which did <hi>aſſume</hi> fleſh: ſo S. <hi>John</hi> tells you, <hi>That the word was made fleſh, joh.</hi> 1. 14. and that that word was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> and <hi>truely God,</hi> verſe 1. And nothing in this point is more clear then that ſaying of Chriſt's, <hi>John 16. 28. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>The aſuming humane nature into unitie of perſon and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the divine, and ſo appearing in the world.</hi> This Scripture abundantly teſtifies (though among the Socinian Doctors it be <hi>commentum hominum ſuperſtitioſorum</hi>) as <hi>Heb. 2. 14. He was made partaker of fleſh and bloud,</hi> and <hi>verſe 16. he took upon him the ſeed of Abraham:</hi> and, <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> John 1. 14. The <hi>humane nature</hi> not exiſting before aſſumed, but aſſumed in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its production by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo that Chriſt took our whole nature, body and ſoul, with all their Faculties, Properties, Affections, nay, with all <hi>natural,</hi> though not<note place="margin">Nihil minus habebat in natura, ſed ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil habebat in culpa; Aug. D. 106. Aug. ibid.</note> ſinfull, <hi>infirmities,</hi> that he might <hi>in all things be like his brethren, ſin onely excepted,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. without converſion or confuſion of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> or <hi>properties.</hi> And in this nature thus aſſumed, <hi>Venit unus ſine peccato, qui ſalvos faceret à peccato,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Auguſtine, One came without ſin, who might ſave from ſin.</hi> He <hi>appeared in the world,</hi> which is the great myſtery the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. namely, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> and by this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>humane nature,</hi> he was capacitated for that great deſign of his coming into the world, which was to ſave ſinners, in order to which, God required a perfect obedience: therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. and <hi>Satisfaction by a price of bloud paid; for without bloud is no remiſsion,</hi> Heb. 9. 22. Both which were by the Juſtice of God to be performed in the ſame nature, which had offended againſt the law, and ſo was liable to death through ſin.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Chriſt obſcuring the glorie of his Divinitie by a veil of fleſh.</hi> For though, as I ſaid before, he parted with none of his glory, yet he much obſcured it by our weak and miſerable nature: though ſome rays of it broke out ſometimes in his diſcourſes, and, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in his miracles, which oft cauſed the beholders to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him the <hi>Son of God;</hi> yet he ſeemed for a time to have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his Majeſtie, and Glorie, while he appeared in the world <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57001:136"/> form or comelineſs.</hi> Therefore, when he was ready to leave the world, ſee how he praies to his Father for a manifeſtatin of that glory, which here was obſcured in the world, <hi>John 17. 5. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glorie which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> where he praies not for any addition, or acceſſion of further glorie, but a diſcovery of the glory of his <hi>Divine nature</hi> through that <hi>humane nature,</hi> which he had aſſumed to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>In taking upon himſelf a ſtate of loweſt abaſement and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. He took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2. 7. and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>quaſi ex</hi> omni <hi>ſeipſum in</hi> nihil <hi>reduxit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza:</hi> and he <hi>became poor for our ſakes,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 9. <hi>Hic erat per divinam majeſtatem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit per humanam infirmitatem,</hi> ſaies <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> He affected not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatneſs and pomp, but declined it: and his life, from the Cradle to the Croſs, was but one continued ſcene of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Chriſt's willing and ready undertaking for ſinners. Coming</hi> is a voluntary motion; Chriſt came into the world, freely, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to undertake the work of ſaving ſinners. <hi>Aſſumpſit animam &amp; carnem hominis, non antea à ſe promerentis, nec ad illam percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endam ſublimitatem virtute propriâ laborantis, ſed omnino gratiâ,</hi> ſaies <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> He was not merited, or pre-engaged, but out of his <hi>love he gave himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> He was not forced to it, but came freely, <hi>John 10. 18. No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed, he is oft ſaid to be ſent of his Father, <hi>John 3. 17. God ſent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world:</hi> and <hi>Gal. 4. 14. When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman;</hi> but it was by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conſent in Chriſt to the councel and deſign of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing Chriſt to the office of a Mediatour: therefore, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. it is ſaid by <hi>Peter</hi> to the ſcoffing Jews, <hi>Him, being delivered by the determinate counſel, and fore knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have cruciſied and ſlain him.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid likewiſe to be ſealed by the Father, <hi>John 6. 27. Him hath God the Father ſealed:</hi> and to be ſanctified and <hi>ſent into the world by the Father,</hi> John 10. 36. but it was by the conſent and condeſcenſion of Chriſt, offering himſelf as a Sponſor, and Mediatour, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to the will of his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 7. Chriſt did voluntarily undertake for us, and his ſubmiſſion to the Father was not an act of the Divine nature, but voluntarily of the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, willingly offering himſelf to his Fathers juſtice, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57001:136"/> of ſinners: and therefore Chriſt is ſaid oft to give himſelf, and that out of mere love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2, 25. This expreſſion of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world</hi> doth not onely ſpeak the event and iſſue, but the deſign, will, and ultimate end of Chriſt's coming: <hi>quòd non gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatum ſalvat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> that <hi>he did it freely and willingly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, This ſpeaks <hi>infinite love;</hi> that God ſhould ſend Chriſt, and Chriſt come to undertake for ſinners. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. and, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life,</hi> John 3. 16. Each word there heightens the love of God, a <hi>Son given, a begotten Son,</hi> an <hi>onely begotten Son,</hi> nay, a <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved Son,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. who was in <hi>the boſome of his Father,</hi> John 1. 18. that God ſhould <hi>not ſpare his Son,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. this muſt needs ſpeak love.</p>
                  <p>It was an argument of <hi>Abraham's</hi> love to God, that at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he with-held not his <hi>Iſaac</hi> (Gen. 22. 2.) from God, who yet gave him, and had power to command him again. But that God ſhould give his Son to the wicked, ungratefull, undeſerving world, muſt needs ſpeak a greater affection then that of <hi>Abraham's</hi> and what can that be leſs then an <hi>infinite love?</hi> When Chriſt did but ſhed a tear for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the Jews collected his love from that: <hi>John</hi> 11. 35, 36. how much more may we that Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſhould come into the world to ſhed his bloud for us? This in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eed is <hi>infinite love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſpeaks <hi>abundance of comfort</hi> to Chriſtians. Is Chriſt come into the world? hath he taken upon him our natures then this ſpeaks comfort to true ſincere Chriſtians,</p>
                  <p>I. In caſe of their <hi>imperfect obedience,</hi> in caſe of their many failings and imperfections. Why, Chriſtian, do but maintain ſinceritie, and preſs on to perfection, and remember that Chriſt hath aſſumed <hi>thy nature,</hi> and in that perfectly fulfilled the Law, and that obedience is made thine through believing, and thou ſo accounted as righteous in the ſight of God; which the Apoſtle ſuggeſts as matter of comfort to Chriſtians, Rom. 8. 3, 4. <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and fox ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh: that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Chriſt in thy nature perfectly fulfilled the law, and that for thee.</p>
                  <p>II. In caſe of outward affliction for Chriſt. Chriſt hath taken
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57001:137"/> 
                     <hi>thy nature,</hi> and ſo is ſenſible of, and ſympathizeth with thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This was one end of Chriſt's coming into the world in our nature, ſubject to many miſeries, <hi>Heb. 4. 15. We have not an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin:</hi> and this muſt needs be matter of comfort. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us how that a part of<note place="margin">Joſeph. l. 7. de bello Jud.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> being ſet on fire by the Jews, in which many of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes periſhed, that this was their comfort, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſee <hi>Ceſar,</hi> for whom they ventred their lives, weep, as affected with their miſery; ſurely, it muſt be much more ſolid comfort for Chriſtians ſuffering for Chriſt, to think that He ſuffers with them. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſaies the voice from heaven to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. and at <hi>verſe</hi> 5. when he ſaid, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> it was anſwered, <hi>I am Jeſus, whom thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt:</hi> yet was his perſecution onely againſt the perſons of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>III. Againſt fear of death. Art thou afraid to die? remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſt hath come into the world, and hath in thy nature <hi>taſted death,</hi> to deliver thee from the fear of it; See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. The tree caſt into the waters ſweetned them; the conſideration of the Croſs and Death of Chriſt will ſweeten death to a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This may inſtruct you in five great duties: or teach you,</p>
                  <p>I. A leſſon of humilitie. Chriſt came into the world in a mean, low condition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the form of a ſervant: the Apoſtle makes this uſe of it, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iz. to teach us humilitie,</hi> Phil. 2. 5, 6. <hi>Let this minde be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus: who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt <hi>emptied</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>verſe 7. exhauſit</hi> is <hi>Tertullian's</hi> word by which he tranſlates it: and art thou full, and bigg with pride? Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have you learn this leſſon from him, <hi>Matth. 11. 29. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Contempt of the world, and diſaffection to outward pomp and greatneſs. Remember thy Saviour came into the world, and had not where to lay his head; and when they would <hi>have made him king,</hi> he <hi>withdrew</hi> himſelf as ſcorning it, <hi>John</hi> 6. 15. He was made poor for thee: this ſhould teach thee to undervalue the world; eſpecially, if Chriſt calls for it; thou mayſt know the world is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth, thy Saviour ſo undervalued it. Thou ſhouldeſt with Saint <hi>Paul count all things loſs for the excellency of Chriſt,</hi> Philip. 3. 8.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:57001:137"/>
                  <p>III. Chearfulneſs in our obedience to Chriſt. He came into the world chearfully, and readily to undertake for thee. It was his <hi>meat and drink to do the will of his Father, viz.</hi> in order to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and how powerfully ought this to provoke Chriſtians to a chearfull obſervance of Chriſt? He came into the world to die for thee; and therefore thou ſhouldeſt in an ingenuous return of thankfulneſs live to him; the Apoſtle judged this a rational infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14, 15. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge; that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but unto him, who died for them, and roſe again.</hi> His coming into the world to die for ſinners offered a holy violence to S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Yea, this was the very end of Chriſt's undertaking, and giving himſelf for us, <hi>Titus 2. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works:</hi> zealous, or ready and chearfull. Chriſt's love prompted him to a willing undertaking for us: and how ſhould it provoke us to a chearfull obedience unto him? <hi>Luke 1. 74, 55. That we, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. Endeavours and deſires to partake of the grace of Chriſt. Chriſt is come into the world, hath taken our nature, and this to that end, that we might partake of his grace: he came into the world as the Son of man, that by him, we might be made the ſons of God.</p>
                  <p>V. And laſtly, Hatred and deteſtation of ſin. This was it, which brought Chriſt from the boſome of his Father, which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his ſides, and wounded his heart, that, in the anguiſh of it, he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> indeed, as to the event, we may crie out with him, <hi>Felix culpa,</hi> it was an happy guilt, which brought us ſuch a Saviour; but in the mean time let us eye our ſins, through the Wounds and Bloud of Chriſt, who <hi>came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> and <hi>mourn. I will pour upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. Thy ſins brought Chriſt into the world, and that leads me to</p>
                  <p>The fourth particular, <hi>viz:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Chriſt's deſign of coming into the world was to ſave</hi>

                  <p>I. <hi>There would have been no neceſsity of his coming.

                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Scripture every where aſſerts the ſalvation of ſinners, as the great end of Chriſts coming into the world:</hi> as <hi>Luke 9. 10. The Son of man is come to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Had not the <hi>ſheep</hi> gone <hi>aſtray,</hi> the <hi>groat</hi> been <hi>loſt,</hi> the <hi>ſon</hi> a <hi>prodigal,</hi> they had never been <hi>ſought</hi> for, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. So <hi>Matth. 20. 28. The ſon of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many;</hi> that is, for the purchaſe of their ſalvation: and again, <hi>Iohn 10. 18. I am come that they-might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, he <hi>came to call ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Matth. 9. 13. Now it is a known rule,, <hi>ſublato fine, tolluntur
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57001:138"/> media ad finem:</hi> if you ſuppoſe not the ordination of the <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>end,</hi> you make them wholly uſeleſs; for the neceſsitie of them is <hi>relative</hi> to the end: and therefore ſuppoſing <hi>man not to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> we cannot rationally imagine Chriſt ſhould have <hi>come into the world,</hi> the Scripture laying down this as the <hi>principal end</hi> of his coming.</p>
                  <p>Two cautions here muſt be obſerved;</p>
                  <p>1. This was his <hi>principal end,</hi> not in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>advancing</hi> of <hi>Gods glory;</hi> which was the <hi>ultimate end</hi> of all Chriſts undertakings. The <hi>ſalvation</hi> of <hi>ſinners</hi> was but <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to this, ſee <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 4. and the glory both of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> was magnified in this: for at the firſt coming of Chriſt was proclaimed <hi>glory to God on high,</hi> Luk. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. Not in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the other <hi>ſubordinate ends:</hi> as <hi>ſetting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians an example, revealing the way of life and ſalvation:</hi> all which were in order to this deſign, as ſhall appear preſently.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Each undertaking of Chriſt had an influence upon, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to this end:</hi> his <hi>birth,</hi> as the Angels ſaid ſhepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. his <hi>death,</hi> that was the <hi>price of our ſalvation, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. he came on purpoſe <hi>to take away ſin, 1 Joh. 3. 5. to deſtroy the works of Satan,</hi> v. 8. to ſet us an <hi>exact example of pietie,</hi> to <hi>reveal to us the way of ſalvation,</hi> to perform all thoſe actions to which he was anointed, and deſigned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. and all theſe in order to the promoting this great end of his coming, the <hi>ſalvation of ſinners.</hi> Now that to which a man orders and levels all his actions, we conclude to be his principal end; ſo here, &amp;c. The prayers he put up, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows he ſuffered, the ſhedding his tears in the garden, his bloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſs, was all to this end; his conflicts with the ſtorms of the world, the frowns and anger of his Father, were all in order to this end.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Scripture highly extolls and magnifies the love of God, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, upon this very account, that he came to ſave ſinners:</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. The love of God would have been leſs admirable in ſending his Son, if he ſhould have taken our nature, though we had never ſinned. Obſerve, I pray, with what account the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the love of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 10. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his ſon to be the propitiation for our ſins:</hi> not for the greater perfection of the world, which is <hi>Scotus</hi> his account. The Scripture is wholly ſilent as to any ſuch reaſon of Chriſts coming, but as a <hi>propitiation for ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. <hi>This was the moſt ſuitable means to ſuch an end.</hi> Chriſts <hi>coming into the world,</hi> as I have formerly opened it, is a moſt proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means for ſaving ſinners: for man by ſin having endeavoured to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſtius, lib. 3. pag.</hi> 2.</note> lift himſelf above the condition of his creation, could by no means
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57001:139"/> be more ſuitably reſtored, then by Chriſts humiliation, and taking upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant.</hi> Man at firſt affected to be like God, <hi>eritis ſicut dii,</hi> and God now to ſave him condeſcends to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the <hi>likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh,</hi> Phil. 2. 7. <hi>and he humbled himſelf to the death of the croſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>Conſider Christ did not come into the world by aſſuming our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the dignity of it:</hi> (for then he might have aſſumed the <hi>angelical nature,</hi> when on the contrary the Apoſtle tells us, he took not on him the <hi>nature of Angels,</hi> Hebr. 2. 16.) but <hi>propter indigentiam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonavent. in d. 3. Art. 2. qu.</hi> 2.</note> becauſe of our <hi>want</hi> and <hi>indigencie,</hi> that we had been utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without him: and therefore the Angels themſelves, when they proclaimed the <hi>birth</hi> of Chriſt to the <hi>ſhepherds,</hi> proclaimed this at the end of it, <hi>Luke 2. 11, 14. Good will towards men.</hi> Therefore had not man been in this indigent, helpleſs, hopeleſs condition, Chriſt had not come into the world: <hi>Si homo non periiſſet, filius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. Tom. 10. p.</hi> 195.</note> 
                     <hi>non veniſſet: perierat homo, venit Deus homo, &amp; inventus eſt homo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VII. And laſtly this doth moſt <hi>heighten that myſterie of Chriſts incarnation, or coming into the world;</hi> &amp; ſerves moſt to enflame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hearts with <hi>pious affection</hi> to, and <hi>holy admiration</hi> of the love of Chriſt in coming into the world: the firſt, becauſe this had not been, unleſs upon the moſt cogent, weightie reaſons, as the <hi>undoing</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> of one of Gods <hi>nobleſt creatures,</hi> and the <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of an <hi>infinite God;</hi> and the latter, that Chriſt ſhould come and condeſcend to take <hi>our nature,</hi> and a ſtate of <hi>humiliation</hi> for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which no other motive could have provoked him to. What thankfull admiration ſhould it create in our hearts, and we ſay with Mary, Luke 1. 46, 47. <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour:</hi> that he ſhould thus <hi>come into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom</hi> we are <hi>chief?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>How</hi> Chriſt carried on <hi>this deſign:</hi> or, in <hi>what reſpects</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Partic.</hi> 5.</note> be ſaid <hi>to ſave ſinners?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Not barely by giving himſelf an example, and pattern for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians imitation.</hi> It is true that <hi>Christum imitari ſalutis via est,</hi> which <hi>Socinus</hi> make his ground for this aſſertion, <hi>to imitate Chriſt is the way to ſalvation.</hi> It lies upon Chriſtians as a <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>walk as he walked, 1 John 2. 6. He that ſaith he abideth in him ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk even as he walked.</hi> And it is one end of Chriſts death, to ſet us a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſsion, 1. Pet 2. 21. Becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> And it is as true that, whoever expects upon good grounds Chriſt for his <hi>purchaſe</hi> muſt take him as his <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>example;</hi> but through the <hi>rebellion</hi> of the fleſh and the <hi>temptation</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> it comes to paſs
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57001:139"/> that the beſt of us can but <hi>imperfectly</hi> imitate him, and ſo ſtill ſtand in need of a Saviour, to ſatiſfie for the <hi>imperfections</hi> of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through whom it muſt be accepted. Beſides, in this ſence the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs may be called Saviours, as ſetting us an example of piety and patience: and ſo the Apoſtle bids us to account of them Jam. 5. 10. <hi>Take, my brethren, the Prophets who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of patience.</hi> And therefore we muſt riſe higher then this, in conceiving Chriſt to ſave ſinners: therefore the Apoſtle, where he propounds the death of Chriſt as an example of patience, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts it alſo as an expiation for ſin, and purchaſe of our pardon, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. where exhorting to patient ſuffering for well-doing after the example of Chriſt, <hi>ver. 21. For even hereunto were ye called: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps;</hi> he adds at <hi>ver. 24. who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own bodie on the tree, that we, being dead to ſin, ſhould live to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by whoſe stripes ye were healed.</hi> And it is the iſſue of Chriſts undertakings, his death and purchaſe, that we are redeemed from ſin, and freed to walk in imitation of Chriſt in righteouſneſs and holineſs: then which Scripture ſpeaks nothing more plainly, as is clear from <hi>Gal. 1. 4. Who gave himſelf for our ſins that he might deliver us from this preſent evil world:</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18. Foraſmuch as ye know, that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo <hi>Titus 1. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Not as Chriſt is an inſtrument to convey ſalvation to ſinners:</hi> which is another account <hi>Socinus</hi> gives why Chriſt may be ſaid to <hi>ſave ſinners.</hi> It is true indeed, that Chriſt doth beſtow and confer eternal ſalvation upon ſinners; yea, but not inſtrumentally, and principally, but in joynt efficiency with his Father, who, as one in <hi>being,</hi> ſo in working, as in <hi>John</hi> 10. 28, 30. therefore he is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the Authour of eternal ſalvation.</hi> Hebr. 5. 9. and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Acts 3. 15. the Prince of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Not onely becauſe he revealed the way of ſalvation to ſinners:</hi> though this be true, yet it is too ſhort and inſufficient: for thus the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Goſpel may be ſaid to ſave ſinners; as laying before them the way, and opening to them the Goſpel of ſalvation. So the Apoſtle of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 22. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 17. it is the confeſſion of the Damoſel poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of divination, <hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation:</hi> &amp; he exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> ſo
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57001:140"/> to preach, as that he may <hi>ſave them that hear him,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. If Chriſt be only in this reſpect a Saviour, then after he had by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine revealed the way to ſalvation, his death was altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; upon which yet Scripture laies the great ſtreſs of ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: <hi>He is the Saviour of the bodie,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 23. he tells you how, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. he <hi>gave himſelf for it,</hi> and expreſly, <hi>Tit. 2. 13, 14. Who gave himſelf for us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Not onely by confirming this doctrine revealed.</hi> It is true, this was one end of Chriſt's coming, ſo ſaies our Saviour himſelf to <hi>Pilate,</hi> demanding of him, <hi>Art thou a king?</hi> John 18. 37. <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth.</hi> But, who can imagine that God ſhould give up his onely begotten wel-beloved Son, expoſe him to the ſcorns of men, frowns of God, and at laſt to a curſed ignominious death, onely for confirmation of Goſpel-doctrine, which was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently done by the innocencie of his life, and his miracles? for it is ſaid of the Apoſtles, <hi>Mark 16. 20. That they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following.</hi> The Martyrs and Apoſtles might as well upon this account be called Saviours, who ſealed to the truth of the Goſpel with their bloud; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Acts 20. 23, 24. The holy Ghost witneſſeth in every city, ſaying, That bonds and afflictions abide me: But none of theſe things move me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear unto my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to testifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi> Chriſt is therefore ſaid to ſave ſinners by way of a real price paid, and purchaſe made: this Scripture ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 28. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Son of man came to give his life; <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>1. <hi>A perfect ſatisfaction to Divine justice;</hi> which required the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſin, either in the perſon offending, or in his ſuretie; hence <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The chastiſement of our peace was upon him:</hi> and <hi>verſe 6. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all: it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> v. 10. and, <hi>He made his ſoul an offering for ſin;</hi> and this ſatisfaction, by reaſon of the dignitie and holineſs of the perſon, was exactly proportionable to whatever the juſtice
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57001:140"/> of God could require for mans ſin. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. he is ſaid to have <hi>purchaſed the Church with his own bloud.</hi> Sin bound us over to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; Chriſt ſatisfied it, and ſo ſaves ſinners: and ſuppoſing God's acceptance of a ſuretie (which was an act of his higheſt grace and favour, and wholly ſubject to the liberty of his Will) his Juſtice could not require a more perfect ſatisfaction then was made by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Pacifying of the wrath of God towards, and reconciling God to ſinners.</hi> Indeed by the <hi>Socinian</hi> divinitie, God and man were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at odds. <hi>Chriſtus non placavit Deum, ſed placatum oſtendit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Socinus.</hi> It is true indeed, that the very coming of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world was an evidence and demonſtration of that great love of benevolence, or that Philanthropie whereby God was inclined to do good to loſt man, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. but no love of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or delight in a ſinner, till actually reconciled by Jeſus Chriſt; but a mutual enmitie between God and man, and a hatred in God to man. <hi>Eph. 2. children of wrath,</hi> and, John 3. <hi>verſe</hi> laſt, <hi>upon him who believeth not, the wrath of God,</hi> which anger and wrath of God ſtands in contradiſtinction and oppoſition, not to the general love of God to his creatures, as ſuch, whereby he may deſign to do them good, but to the the ſpecial love and friendſhip of God to, and delight in his creature, which cannot be till juſtice be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and reconciliation perfected by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. Rom.</hi> 3. 25. that is, his Juſtice in puniſhing ſin: and, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15, 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom, reconciliation</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>enmitie,</hi> and <hi>making peace</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>oppoſition;</hi> till which be removed, the Holineſs, and Juſtice of God permits not the ſalvation of any ſinner.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Pardon and juſtification from guilt,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. we are ſaid <hi>to be juſtified freely by his grace: freely</hi> in reſpect of us who confer nothing to it; <hi>by grace,</hi> in reſpect of Divine acceptation of this price paid by Chriſt, yet by <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> if we reſpect Chriſt, who came into the world to die, and by death to <hi>purchaſe our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Rom. 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>So then, Juſtice being ſatisfied, God reconciled, and guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the undertaking of Chriſt, the deſign of ſaving ſinners, for which he came into the world, is effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.</p>

                     <hi>order to this end,</hi> viz. <hi>man's ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay down theſe ſix poſitions for the determination of this</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>It is abſolutely impoſsible that the ſinner ſhould be ſaved, till ſin
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57001:141"/> by ſome means be removed, and taken away.</hi> As it is contrary to God's <hi>revealed will</hi> to ſave any man in his ſin, without repentance and faith in Chriſt; ſo it is a contradiction to the holineſs and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his nature, as being a God of <hi>purer eyes then to behold evil,</hi> as it is <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. I like not to diſpute the abſoluteneſs of God's power; but we muſt have a care of exalting God's power to the prejudice of his Holineſs: as ſoon may God leave to hate ſin (that is, as ſoon may God lay aſide his nature) as ſave any man obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately continuing and dying in his ſin.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>It was not abſolutely neceſſary for Chriſt to come into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Not by any neceſſity of <hi>coaction,</hi> for he undertook this work willingly; hence it is ſaid, <hi>Iſaiah 53. 12. He poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> &amp;c. to note the willingneſs of Chriſt in the work. Beſides, it could not be abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe God might, without any prejudice to his Juſtice, have ſuffered man finally to have periſhed in his apoſtaſie: nor was he any way more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then by his love and mercie, to provide for the recoverie of loſt man, more then the <hi>Apostate Angels;</hi> therefore Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture evidenceth the love of Chriſt by this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>III. Suppoſing God's deſign of ſaving ſinners, <hi>This was the moſt convenient way.</hi> This I finde readily aſſented to by all, that it was moſt convenient every way: both</p>
                  <p>1. In reſpect of God, that the diſhonour, which he had received by ſin, might be repaired by the undertakings of a perſon of infinite dignitie, as Chriſt was.</p>
                  <p>2. That ſinners might be ſaved with ſecuritie to all Divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, by ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, by Chriſt's ſufferings in the ſame nature, which had offended.</p>
                  <p>3. For ſecurity to his Holy Law, by Chriſt's unſinning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and</p>
                  <p>4. With the higheſt exaltation of his Mercy; for <hi>abundantio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris erat miſericordiae, quàm ſi peccata abſque ſatisfactione dimiſiſſet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi> The Apoſtle from hence magnifies the riches of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aq. 3. p. q. 46. art.</hi> 10.</note> God's mercy, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Hereby God did alſo moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably communicate himſelf to the creature; a greater was not poſſible then a perſonal union to the humane nature. And then</p>
                  <p>5. Moſt convenient in reſpect of us, as being the moſt cogent incentive of love to God: <hi>Ferrea &amp; lapidea corda eſſe oportet, quae non emolliet tam incomparabilis amoris divini ſuavitas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calv. in Joan.</hi> 15. 13.</note> Hereby we have the advantage of an exact copie of all vertue, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, patience, conſtancie, juſtice, and the like, and the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57001:141"/> motive to imitate it in all holineſs and piety, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. v. laſt. And then,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It was moſt eminent in reſpect of Satan, that he might be more ſhamed and confounded, by being conquered in the nature, which he had ſeduced and ruined.</p>
                  <p>IV. Suppoſing the decree of God, and his revelation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mankinde, <hi>Man's recovery and ſalvation was as impoſsible any other way, then by Chriſt's coming into the world, as it is for God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be fruſtrated, or his will to be fallible, or plainly for God to lye.</hi> To which purpoſe theſe Scriptures ſpeak expreſly, <hi>Acts 4. 12. Acts 2. 23. Luke 22. 22. Luke</hi> 24. 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Suppoſing God's purpoſe of ſaving ſinners by way of a price and ſatisfaction, Christ's coming into the world was indiſpenſably neceſſarie.</hi> And in this <hi>Eſtius,</hi> though he thinks it poſſible, that mankinde might have been recovered, and reconciled to God by a <hi>mere man,</hi> or an <hi>Angel,</hi> yet this would not have been a <hi>redemption by an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate price</hi> or <hi>purchaſe,</hi> becauſe Juſtice required ſatisfaction in the <hi>nature offending,</hi> every individual of which being corrupted, and ſo obnoxious to Juſtice, and indebted to God in more then it was able to pay (as deriving all from him) was incapable of ſatisfying for its own ſcore, much leſs for the ſin of all mankinde: but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a man created pure, or an Angel, ſtill the obedience of this creature would be but finite, and ſo in the rigor of Juſtice unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to expiate an offence againſt an infinite Majeſtie, or to repair that diſhonour and injurie which ſin doth to God; and then, the more the creature is enabled to do, the more it is indebted, therefore cannot merit, or ſatisfie for former ſin, <hi>Pſal. 49. 7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ranſome for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VI. And laſtly, <hi>It is hard to conceive and imagine ſuch a power ſo abſolute in God, as by which</hi> (ſuppoſing ſin and the creature fallen from him) <hi>he ſhould reſtore and ſave it, without the undertakings of Chriſt.</hi> I confeſs I approve not the raſh curious ſearchings into the depth of God's power, as eſteeming it more the dutie of Chriſtians, thankfully and piouſly to admire God's revelation of mans reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by Chriſt, then nicely to enquire of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſemel o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendit Deus quid fieri ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, ſtulta eſt ac noxia de poſsibilitate diſputatio.</hi> Calv. <hi>in Job.</hi> 16. 7.</note> poſſibility of another way of ſalvation. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, God could have done it <hi>ſolo nutu &amp; verbo,</hi> as he created all things at firſt by a word; which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cloſe with, for ſurely God would never have given up his Son to ſuch miſeries and ſorrows, might ſinners have been ſaved by a word ſpeaking: this detracts from the glory of Chriſt's underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings for ſinners. <hi>Eſtius</hi> thinks that <hi>minima paſsio Chriſti ſufficere potuiſſet pro juſto pretio redemptionis mundi:</hi> by reaſon of the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57001:142"/> of the perſon; but neither can this be without the falling of God's truth to the ground, the truth I mean of this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Gen. 2. 17. Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat: for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> which muſt be made good either in the <hi>perſons ſinning,</hi> and ſo man had bin irrecoverably loſt; or in Chriſt, as their ſurety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death on him was indiſpenſably required by this threatning: therefore, this ſpecial way by the death of Chriſt was neceſſary, though not abſolutely, as I ſhewed before, yet <hi>ex ſuppoſitione finis,</hi> ſuppoſing God's purpoſe of ſaving ſinners after the threatning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p>To make out this, conſider three things.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>The indiſpenſableneſs of God's juſtice, requiring the puniſhment of, and ſatisfaction for ſin.</hi> A truth, which every man carries a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of in his own breaſt, even thoſe who were wholly ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to God's revealed will of puniſhing ſinners: the <hi>Heathens</hi> I mean, who had inward fears of an avenging juſtice for ſin. And, if we aſſert juſtice to be an attribute eſſential to God, we muſt aſſert, I think, that God puniſhes ſin out of nature, not will onely, (though all the circumſtances of puniſhment be ſubjected in the freedom of God's will) otherwiſe, we muſt ſuppoſe it poſſible for God not to hate ſin; and ſo ſin, or no ſin, would be all one to God: now the Scripture founds God's hatred to ſin in his nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. if then the juſtice of God be indiſpenſable, then ſatisfaction muſt be made before the ſinner can be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>The impoſsibilitie of ſatisfaction to juſtice any other way then by the undertaking of Chriſt.</hi> For no mere creature could lay down a price ſatisfactorie for the ſalvation of loſt man, though <hi>Aquinas</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aq. 3. p. q. 1. art.</hi> 2.</note> thinks, that the obedience of the creature might have been avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſalvation of ſinners, yet confeſſeth that this would have been <hi>Satisfactio ſufficiens imperfectè ſecundùm acceptionem Dei, non perfectè per adaequationem ad compenſationem culpae commiſſae: onely ſatisfaction improperly to divine acceptation, not properly by a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable compenſation for an offence againſt an infinite God:</hi> but of this formerly.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Chriſt did by his undertakings fully and perfectly ſatisfie Gods juſtice, in order to the ſalvation of ſinners:</hi> hereby fully repairing the diſhonour God ſuſtained by ſin, by an obedience more ſatisfactory to God, then ſin was diſpleaſing; his undertakings were the actions of an infinite perſon, and ſo proportionable to ſatisfie for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil that is in ſin, and it was in it ſelf compleat, not depending in its worth upon divine acceptation to ſupply any defect in it: but ſuppoſing Gods acceptation of that ſatisfaction from a ſurety
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57001:142"/> which he might have required in our perſons (which is of infinite love and grace) he could not refuſe this, or require a more full price, and perfect ſatisfaction; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 14. To ſumme up this, Gods juſtice required ſatisfaction, the creature could not give it; Chriſt as God-man made it, and onely could do it; therefore ſuppoſing the deſign of God to ſave ſinners, Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the world to undertake and die for ſinners was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Upon what accounts this is an acceptable doctrine.</hi>

                  <p>I. The expreſſion in the Text ſpeaks it ſo, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion never uſed by the Apoſtle, but in matters of the higheſt concernment and importance; as,</p>

                  <p>3. In <hi>encouraging Chriſtians to ſuffer with Chriſt:</hi> as 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 10, 11, 12, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, It is a faithfull ſaying.</hi> It is true, <hi>afflictions</hi> in themſelves are not <hi>acceptable;</hi> but conſidering who-ever ſuffers with and for Chriſt; and how the <hi>croſs</hi> uſhers in the <hi>crown;</hi> how if we <hi>ſuffer with him,</hi> we ſhall alſo <hi>reign with him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith: it muſt needs be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>nature of the thing</hi> ſpeaks it <hi>acceptable;</hi> take it under theſe ſix plain notions.</p>
                  <p>1. As a <hi>revelation of pardon and mercy to guilty condemned male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours.</hi> How acceptable is the news of <hi>pardon</hi> to a <hi>ſentenced</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, expecting <hi>daily execution?</hi> ſuch is the Goſpel revealing Chriſts <hi>coming</hi> into the world to <hi>ſave ſinners.</hi> We are all in our natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>guiltie, liable,</hi> and <hi>ſentenced to death;</hi> John 3. 8. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not is condemned already.</hi> When the ſoul comes to be humbled for ſin, and lyes under ſad fears, and expectation of the execution of this ſentence; O! how acceptable muſt the revelation of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> needs be, through the undertaking of Chriſt for ſinners? ſuch <hi>free pardon,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. nothing in reference to us though in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſts bloud ſhed, when he came, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. As <hi>a proclamation of peace to enemies.</hi> How acceptable is an <hi>Embaſsie</hi> of peace from a <hi>prince</hi> to his <hi>ſubjects,</hi> who are in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? We were up in <hi>Armes,</hi> in <hi>open hoſtilitie</hi> againſt God, and by
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57001:143"/> our firſt apoſtaſie had caſt of our obedience, and broken our <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi> now God by the Goſpel proclaims <hi>peace</hi> to ſuch rebels through Chriſt pacifying his Fathers wrath, and undertaking for mans offence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Chriſt purchaſed our peace by his bloud, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20, 22. Chriſt offer'd himſelf a <hi>hoſtage,</hi> a <hi>ſurety,</hi> nay a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to procure our peace, and in the <hi>fulneſs of time</hi> came himſelf into the world to proclaim this <hi>peace,</hi> Eph. 2. 17. viz. to the Jews in his <hi>perſon,</hi> to the Gentiles by the Apoſtles his <hi>meſſengers:</hi> thus Chriſt ſpoke in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by him proclaimed this peace; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. and ſtill ſends his Miniſters his <hi>heraulds,</hi> and <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours</hi> to ſolicite your reconciliation to God, that you would lay aſide the enmity of your hearts againſt God, and to proclaim God reconciled to you. <hi>He hath committed to us the word of reconciliation,</hi> read this fully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20. The firſt Proclamation of Chriſts coming into the world by thoſe heavenly heraulds was <hi>peace on earth;</hi> Luk. 2. 14. and ſurely <hi>dulce nomen pacis,</hi> as being a complex of all good deſirable.</p>
                  <p>3. As <hi>a proclamation of liberty to captives, and bond-men.</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how acceptable would a <hi>releaſe</hi> be to a <hi>Turkiſh-gallie-ſlave;</hi> or how gratefull the releaſe from the <hi>bondage of Egypt</hi> to the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites bound for <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo, and much more ſurely, muſt the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty and freedome procured by Chriſt be to ſouls enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>led captive by Satan at his will,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. With what ectaſie of joy were the Jews returning from Babylon ſurprized, that they doubted whether the thing were true or not? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 1, 2. This return and deliverance figured out our <hi>redemption</hi> and freedome by Chriſt, as appears from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. taken from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 21, 22. So, ſure, to thoſe who know what it is to be in bondage to ſin, and ſlavery to Satan, to thoſe who do not love their <hi>chaines</hi> (as truth is we all naturally do) the revelation of that freedome, wherewith Chriſt hath ſet us free, muſt needs be moſt welcome. Our natural eſtate is an eſtate of <hi>ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> John 8. 34. <hi>Whoſoever commiteth ſin is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> the Goſpel reveales libertie through Jeſus Chriſt, v. 36. and how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable is this? The <hi>chief captain</hi> priz'd his <hi>liberty,</hi> becauſe he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it with a <hi>great ſumme of money,</hi> Acts 22. 28. how much more valuable and acceptable is that Goſpel which reveales this libertie, bought at no leſs expence then the <hi>bloud of Chriſt (1 Pet.</hi> 1. 18.) from <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> to whom you were enſlaved. We conclude them mad-men, that do not prize liberty, and ſurely they are not in their wits, who account not this a <hi>faithfull ſaying</hi> and <hi>acceptable,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt is come into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. As <hi>a diſcovery of treaſures and riches to poor and beggerly perſons.</hi>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:57001:143"/> How acceptable is the finding of a <hi>pearl</hi> of price to a <hi>poor man?</hi> and ſo Chriſt muſt needs be to ſinners, who are naturally <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 17. And ſo Chriſt would be indeed, were it not for the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of mens hearts, that we are apt to ſay as they did, that <hi>we are rich and encreaſed in goods, and ſtand in need of nothing;</hi> and that's the reaſon Chriſt is no more acceptable to ſinners. There are <hi>treaſures hid in Jeſus Christ;</hi> Coloſſ. 2. 3. and he came into the world that we might partake of thoſe <hi>riches, (2 Cor.</hi> 8. 9.) and be rich with thoſe <hi>durable riches</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> which are in the hands of <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> Prov. 8. 18. Chriſt is that <hi>pearl</hi> in the <hi>field</hi> of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 46.</note> which (<hi>Chriſtians</hi>) will enrich us, though we part with all to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it.</p>
                  <p>5. As <hi>an offer of cure to diſeaſed perſons.</hi> That's our condition out of Chriſt, as I have largly ſhewd before, now the Goſpel reveales healing by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 4. I will heal their back-ſliding.</hi> Chriſt came into the world to be both our <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> and <hi>phyſick: de pulvere creatus de pulvere ſanaris; caro te creaverat, caro te ſanat,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. As <hi>the marrow, ſumme, and center of the Goſpel.</hi> What the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> deſired (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56.) the <hi>Prophets</hi> foretold, the <hi>types</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached, the <hi>promiſes</hi> contain, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> ſeal, the <hi>covenant</hi> of grace aſſures, whatever concernes a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans comfort or happineſs is <hi>epitomized</hi> and <hi>ſumm'd</hi> up in this; that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners:</hi> and therefore it is <hi>worthie of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To the miniſters.</hi> Let them then preach this acceptable doctrine, and lay open this truth, the great deſign of God in <hi>ſaving ſinners</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt is the ſumme of the Goſpel, and ſo ſhould be of our preaching. Obſerve the Apoſtles practiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. preaching <hi>Christ</hi> in oppoſition to their <hi>carnal wiſdome,</hi> which the Greekes affected, ver. 22. and though it be a <hi>ſtumbling-block to the Jews,</hi> and <hi>to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> ver. 29. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> preacht Chriſt at <hi>Athens,</hi> though the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> there accounted him but a <hi>babler</hi> for it, and a <hi>ſetter forth of ſtrange gods,</hi> Acts 17. 18. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> took <hi>occaſion</hi> from the <hi>Prophet</hi> to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 25. So ſhould the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt take <hi>all occaſions</hi> to preach Chriſt; they are his Embaſſadours to negotiate for him in the world, they have both their <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>commiſsion</hi> from him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 11. and therefore ſhould act for him and <hi>preach</hi> his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt up: S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you why he was commiſſionated to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57001:144"/> of the Goſpel, for this very end to <hi>preach Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 7, 8. <hi>Brethren,</hi> we are Gods Truſtees (as I may ſay) to whom he hath <hi>committed the Goſpel,</hi> as 'tis 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. We are falſe to our <hi>truſt,</hi> if we don't preach Chriſt, who is the <hi>ſumme</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Auſtin</hi> laid this to the charge of <hi>Tullies</hi> workes, for which he rejected them, that <hi>he did not finde the name of Chriſt in them,</hi> and may not many diſlike our Sermons, as hearing no more of Chriſt in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Then, <hi>how acceptable ſhould the miniſtry of the Goſpel be to you? How beautifull even the feet of thoſe who bring you theſe glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> What proviſion is made for the entertainment of <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</hi> who come to a Nation on terms of <hi>peace?</hi> ſo ſhould the <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours</hi> of Chriſt be acceptably entertained, as <hi>commiſsionated</hi> from Chriſt, to offer <hi>rebellious ſinners</hi> terms of <hi>peace,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 8. The Apoſtle tells us thoſe are <hi>ministerial gifts,</hi> Eph. 4. 11. It is the Apoſtles exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 12. We beſeech you, brethren, to know them which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among you;</hi> what's that? their work is to diſcover and offer Chriſt to you. Surely, the <hi>dove</hi> was very welcome into the <hi>Ark,</hi> when ſhe brought an <hi>olive branch</hi> in her mouth, the <hi>Embleme</hi> of <hi>peace:</hi> ſo acceptable ſhould the miniſtry of the Word be, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals Chriſt as your peace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Examine <hi>whether you be of the number of thoſe ſinners Chriſt came to ſave.</hi> You will ſay, that's needleſs, <hi>Did not Chriſt come to ſave all? Is it not ſaid expreſſely, Chriſt died for all? 2 Cor. 5. 15. and that he taſted death for every man? Hebr. 2. 9. and that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the whole world unto himſelf? 2 Cor.</hi> 15. 19. How far Chriſts <hi>intentions</hi> extended in his <hi>undertakings,</hi> would be too large to diſcuſs; it will be ſufficient at preſent to note, that the <hi>price</hi> Chriſt paid is <hi>ſufficient</hi> in it ſelf for the expiation of all ſins, and that it extends to <hi>all ſorts</hi> of ſinners; notwithſtanding this, we know from Scripture, that the greateſt part of the world ſhall <hi>periſh,</hi> even of thoſe who are under the Goſpel; <hi>Many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen;</hi> and Chriſt doth expreſſely reſtrain that <hi>univerſality</hi> which many to little purpoſe contend for, when he ſaith, he <hi>laid down his life for his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10. 15. to <hi>redeem his Church,</hi> Acts 20. 28. and to <hi>ſave</hi> onely <hi>his own people,</hi> Matth. 1. 21. and <hi>for thoſe who were given him of his Father;</hi> in contradiſtinction to the <hi>world,</hi> Joh. 17. 9, Therefore there is room left for enquiry, whether we be of the number of them who ſhall be ſaved by Chriſts <hi>undertakings</hi> for us. Such are</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Repenting, returning ſinners:</hi> ſo Chriſt tells you himſelf, Matth. 9. 13. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:57001:144"/> that is, ſuch as are not righteous in their own opinion, for as if man had continued truely righteous, he had not ſtood in need of a Saviour; ſo if <hi>ſelf righteous;</hi> he ſhall receive no benefit by Chriſt: ſuch he came not to call, but <hi>ſinners. So,</hi> you'l ſay, <hi>we are all:</hi> yea, but <hi>humbled ſinners;</hi> ſuch as are inwardly convinced and truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſin. <hi>Queſt.</hi> But <hi>doth not Chriſt call all?</hi> Matth. 11. 28. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, but mark the limitation: ſuch as are <hi>weary,</hi> there's <hi>eaſe</hi> for ſuch: ſo <hi>Luke 19. 10. The ſon of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt. So we were all loſt,</hi> you'l ſay: True, but theſe are ſuch as <hi>ſee</hi> themſelves loſt, and irrecoverably undone without Chriſt. The <hi>prodigal</hi> was loſt long, but never returned to, nor was entertained by his Father, till he ſaw himſelf ſo, and mourned that he was ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18. Chriſts commiſſion was to <hi>binde up</hi> ſuch onely as <hi>mourn,</hi> and to <hi>proclaim peace,</hi> and <hi>the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> to ſuch onely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Believing ſinners:</hi> thoſe are the terms upon which the Goſpel offers ſalvation by Chriſt, for ſo runs the promiſe, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And Chriſt tells you himſelf; he came into the world for this end, <hi>John 12. 46. I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth on me, ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi> And this was the deſign of God's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt for ſinners, that, <hi>Whoever believed ſhould not periſh,</hi> John 3. 16. This is the condition of the Covenant of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Scripture every where expreſſeth: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. to this <hi>Paul</hi> directed the <hi>trembling jayler, Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31. All a Chriſtians life is in Chriſt, and faith is the hand that receives him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 72. Whatever a Chriſtian derives from, or partakes of by Chriſt, as <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> Acts 10. 43. is all by faith: the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. <hi>inward puritie,</hi> Acts 15. 9. <hi>perſeverance,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>ſon-ſhip,</hi> Gal. 3. 26. and at laſt, <hi>eternal ſalvation by Chriſt,</hi> John 3. 36. all which are received by faith.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Reforming ſinners.</hi> Chriſt came not to ſave any man <hi>in his ſins,</hi> but <hi>from his ſins,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquitie. Utique venit medicus ad aegrotum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt. Tom. 10. p.</hi> 200.</note> 
                     <hi>constat, ſed ideo venit medicus ad aegrotum, nè ſemper ſit aegrotus. Quod vult facere amat, non quod invenit,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Whether do you then live, as thoſe Chriſt came to ſave? Chriſt came not to ſave you onely from the guilt of ſin, but from the power of ſin, <hi>that ſin might have no more dominion over you,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. So that let no preſumptuous ſinner flatter himſelf in a continuance of ſin, upon this conſideration, that Chriſt came to <hi>ſave ſinners,</hi> for Chriſt ſaves and delivers them <hi>from ſin</hi> here, whom he ſaves <hi>from wrath</hi> hereafter, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. And the promiſe of mercy is made
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57001:145"/> upon <hi>forſaking ſin,</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Whoſoever confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall have mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let us all heartily entertain this ſo acceptable a doctrine, as that meſſage of Chriſt's coming to ſave ſinners.</hi> Entertain it in your ear, by attendance upon the Goſpel preached; but that is a ſmall matter: welcome it in your hearts, by believing it; otherwiſe, it will not profit you; as it is ſaid of them, <hi>Heb. 4. 3. The word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> And not onely ſo, but in your lives too, by obeying it, and living ſuitably to the Goſpel, which diſcovers this acceptable doctrine to you, <hi>Phil. 1. 27. Let your converſation be ſuch as beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> The end of this Goſpel-revelation was obedience and holineſs, ſuitable to our belief: ſo the <hi>myſterie</hi> of Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>made known to all nations for the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16. 26. for ſo our lives may witneſs our acceptance and hearty entertainment of this, as <gap reason="foreign">

But the Apoſtle ſpoke not to know what others thought of him, but he ſpoke the real ſence, and inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of his ſoul, when he ſaith, <hi>Of whom I am chief.</hi> Why the Apoſtle ſpeaks this, and how he could truely ſay it of himſelf (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, as an Apoſtle converted, and brought home to Chriſt) I ſhall ſhew you in theſe eight particulars.</p>
                  <p>Conſider the words, as</p>

Of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the humbleſt, who often reflected on his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, natural condition.

                  </p>
                  <p>That's the firſt.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Vox aggravantis peccatum.</hi> The Apoſtle here, reſpecting the circumſtances of his ſins, whereby they were aggravated and heightned, calls himſelf, <hi>the greatest of ſinners,</hi> becauſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>a furious perſecution</hi> of the Chuch of God, it being eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with rage and malice, <hi>Acts 26. 10, 11. Many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon, having received authoritie from the chief Prieſts, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them: And I
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57001:146"/> puniſhed them oft in every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme, and being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange cities.</hi> Where you ſee the height of iniquitie, to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting but a <hi>clear knowledge,</hi> to make it unpardonable; upon the account of which circumſtance of his ſin, he eſteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>unworthy the name of an Apoſtle, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 9. And another heightning aggravation of his ſin was, That <hi>it was done in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> verſe 13. where ſome for, <hi>becauſe,</hi> read, <hi>quamvis, although,</hi> and ſo make it an aggravation of his ſin, and a further commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mercy of God in pardoning; for his ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, muſt needs have been in a great meaſure wilfull and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he enjoying the means of faith and knowledge. A high ſin que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs. <hi>Alenſis</hi> gives this reaſon of it, <hi>Quia deſtruit fundamentum totius Chriſtianae religionis:</hi> whereas other ſins ſtrike but at ſome <hi>particular vertue.</hi> And beſides, if this be final, it is the <hi>cord</hi> which ties <hi>all other</hi> ſins upon the ſoul, and makes it in the event <hi>damning.</hi> And then, farther, as they were ſins againſt <hi>knowledge;</hi> the Apoſtle having been <hi>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel;</hi> and that's a high ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of ſin. <hi>James 4. 17. To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> Now the Apoſtle eying all theſe, calls himſelf <hi>the greateſt of ſinners:</hi> whence obſerve a <hi>diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> between a ſincere Chriſtian, and an hollow-hearted hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: <hi>he</hi> extenuates and leſſens his ſin, with the <hi>unjuſt ſteward</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down <hi>fiftie</hi> for an <hi>hundred,</hi> but heightens his but ſeeming and pretended holineſs; the world ſhall hear of it, if the <hi>Phariſees</hi> faſt <hi>twice a week,</hi> and tithe <hi>mint</hi> and <hi>cummin:</hi> but a <hi>ſincere humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> in mentioning his graces and gifts is lowly, but full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in aggravating his ſins; thus good <hi>Hagar,</hi> Prov. 30. 2, 3. <hi>Surely, I am more brutiſh then any man, and have not the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man: I neither learned wiſdome, nor have the knowledge of the Holy.</hi> The <hi>Publican</hi> ſmites upon his breaſt, with a <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> &amp;c. And we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an example of both, then our Apoſtle; who <hi>of Saints</hi> counted himſelf the <hi>leaſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 8. but here of <hi>ſinners</hi> the <hi>greateſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Vox eſſe accuſantis: The words of a ſelf condemning and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſing Chriſtian.</hi> S. <hi>Paul's</hi> eyes were turned inward upon his own ſins' not prying too nicely into the ſins of other men; ſo that this ſpeaks at once the Apoſtles humilitie and charitie; his charitie prompted him to think and judge better of others, though his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie would not ſuffer him to think otherwaies of himſelf. And here is another character of a true Chriſtian, as diſtinct from an
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57001:146"/> hypocrite: hypocrites are quick-ſighted, eagle-eyed abroad, but blinde at home. Some ſhifting off their ſins to others, nay, to God himſelf, rather then charge themſelves with them. It is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie miſcarriage, derived from our firſt parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. Another ſort <hi>ſeemingly zealous,</hi> and rigid in cenſuring others, never condemning themſelves, though guiltie perhaps of greater ſins, then what they ſo ſeverely cenſure in others: believe it, to cenſure uncharitably in others what we reform not in our ſelves, is but counterfeit and hypocritical. That zeal, which is ready to conſume others, and yet burns not up our <hi>own corruptions,</hi> is but the wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire of paſſion and ſelfiſh deſign. The Phariſee, whoſe prayer was hypocriſie, would ſee oft a mote in his brothers eye, and pretend to a skill and deſire to pull it out, when he neglects the beam in his own. He that is ſo much abroad, it is to be feared he ſeldome turns his eyes inward, to conſider the plague of his own heart. The Phariſee boaſts, that he <hi>is not as the Publican;</hi> but the good Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſtrikes upon his own breaſt, and ſaith, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi> It is our dutie, Brethren, to reprove others, but nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably to condemn them. This <hi>cenſorious uncharitableneſs</hi> is commonly the iſſue of a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> opinion of a mans own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. It was otherwiſe with the diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 18, 19. they ſay not, <hi>Is it he?</hi> or, <hi>he?</hi> but each ready to ſuſpect and accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> ſo the Apoſtle here accuſeth himſelf by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular indictment, here in the groſs, <hi>of whom I am the chief.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in reſpect of others, a Chriſtian thinks it better to wrong himſelf by an over <hi>charitable credulitie,</hi> then others by <hi>unjuſt cenſures and ſuſpicions,</hi> but before God none accuſe themſelves more, hereby magnifying more the <hi>grace</hi> of God in pardoning: <hi>haec ejus accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio eſt laus ſalvatoris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, accuſing himſelf he exalts his Saviour, who came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> of whom he accuſeth himſelf <hi>as the chief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the third.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Vox ſpiritualiter illuminati:</hi> as the words of the Apoſtle <hi>inwardly enlightned</hi> to ſee and diſcern the nature of his former ſins, and this is one thing in which every true Chriſtian is enlightned. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his unregenerate eſtate thought in his conſcience, he was bound to oppoſe the Goſpel of Chriſt, as he tells you himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. but now he diſcovers the horrid nature of his <hi>blaſphemie,</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> and therefore oft heightens it, <hi>Gal. 1. 13. Carnal hearts</hi> do not ſee the evil of ſin, and therefore think it a light ſmall matter; they'l be playing with the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> as not feeling the <hi>ſting</hi> of it; but when a Chriſtian <hi>ſpiritually enlightned</hi> ſees ſin through the <hi>glaſs of the law,</hi> and the <hi>bloud of Chriſt,</hi> it appears in its proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57001:147"/> Thus to S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the law ſin appeared <hi>exceeding ſinfull,</hi> Rom. 7. and himſelf here <hi>The greatest of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That's the fourth.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Vox confitentis: as the words of S. Paul confeſsing his ſin.</hi> He was <hi>primus in ordine confitentium,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aretius</hi> upon the place, as readie to acknowledge his ſin as any; and ſurely this is a great Chriſtian <hi>dutie:</hi> however many now a-days are high-flown into raptures, and ecſtaſies, and cry down <hi>Confeſsion</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> as <hi>legal.</hi> The Saints in Scripture have been expreſs and frequent in this duty; <hi>David</hi> frequently in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 32. 5. and fully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 2, 4, 5. confeſſes his original corruption. Read holy <hi>Ezra's</hi> confeſſion, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 5, 6. See <hi>Daniels</hi> holy and humble confeſſion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 4. he recounts <hi>particular</hi> ſins, v. 5, 6. ſo continues till v. 16. thus <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 13. and here, <hi>I am the chief of ſinners.</hi> Hereby Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans acknowledge their liableneſs to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and magnifie the <hi>grace</hi> of God in pardoning, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 13. yet he obtained <hi>mercy.</hi> Much like this of the Apoſtle is that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his book <hi>de poenitentia; Peccator omnium notarum ſum, nec ulli rei niſi poenitentiae natus:</hi> that is, <hi>I am a moſt notorious ſinner, as if I were born to no other end, then to confeſs, and repent.</hi> That brings me to the ſixth thing, as they are,</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>Vox dolentis:</hi> as the words of S. Paul <hi>mourning and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> in the remembrance of his former, and meditation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſins: <hi>ut ſe humiliet adhuc dolet de ſua incredulitate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the place; <hi>the Apoſtle still mournes upon the conſideration of his unbelief.</hi> Though many even of thoſe, who crucified Chriſt, as thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 2. were brought to a ſence of their ſin, yet none more then <hi>Paul,</hi> who now converted, yet grieves for his former unbelief. True Chriſtians are tender hearted, &amp; ſo eaſily <hi>melted</hi> into ſorrow. It is one thing, which God workes upon the heart in <hi>converſion,</hi> viz. a <hi>melting tenderneſs under ſin.</hi> How doth <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>notorious,</hi> ſhed a <hi>fountain</hi> of teares? how tender was <hi>Davids</hi> heart, when he had cut of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and <hi>numbred the people,</hi> 2. Sam. 24. 10. And Chriſtians oft mourn, (even after God hath pardoned them) that they ſhould by ſin formerly ſo much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. I queſtion not but upon this account <hi>David</hi> watered his <hi>couch</hi> with his <hi>tears;</hi> and ſome ſay <hi>Peter</hi> never heard the <hi>cock crow,</hi> but he wept for the <hi>denyal</hi> of his Maſter: and <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>confeſsions</hi> often aggravates and heightens his ſin, while a <hi>Manichee;</hi> ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here reflecting upon his former <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> &amp;c. ſeemes with a <hi>tear</hi> in his eye to cry out, <hi>Of whom I am the chief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VII. <hi>Vox ingemeſcent is ſub onere;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks this as <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the burden of ſin;</hi> ſo that he was <hi>the greatest of ſinners</hi> in reſpect
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57001:147"/> of his <hi>own ſence,</hi> and <hi>feeling.</hi> As ſuppoſe one ſick of the <hi>tooth-ach,</hi> or <hi>head-ach,</hi> cries out, <hi>No pain is like my pain,</hi> becauſe he feels that by experience, but other mens by <hi>ſpeculation</hi> only; ſo the Apoſtle here from an inward ſence of his own ſins calls himſelf <hi>the chief of ſinners.</hi> Here's again a <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> He is one, to whom ſin is a <hi>real</hi> burthen, whereas a <hi>wicked</hi> man makes light of it, ſin is there in its proper place. A <hi>wicked</hi> man is in his <hi>Element,</hi> when ſinning, and <hi>Elementa non gravitant in propriis locis;</hi> but a Chriſtian having a heart of <hi>fleſh</hi> ſo tender, the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſin is a <hi>burthen</hi> to him. <hi>David</hi> complains of his broken bones by reaſon of ſin: and that his ſins <hi>were a burthen too heavie for him to bear;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> here confeſſeth himſelf <hi>the chief of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VIII. <hi>Vox fidei applicantis:</hi> the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> by a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faith applying to himſelf that general truth, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">

See, he applies the <hi>general</hi> mercy of God to himſelf. It is not enough to believe in the general that <hi>Christ came to ſave ſinners</hi> (for this is but <hi>historical,</hi> which <hi>the divels believe, and tremble</hi> becauſe they have no part in him, and thouſands will be damned, who profeſs they believe this:) but true <hi>ſaving</hi> faith is a <hi>fiducial relyance upon, and particular application of Chriſt,</hi> as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſave <hi>me</hi> in particular, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. ſo, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 22. and <hi>hereafter there is layd up for me a crown,</hi> &amp;c. c. 4. v. 8. and here he brings down this general doctrine by a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf, <hi>of whom I am the chief.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I. <hi>See hence why this Doctrine finds no more entertainment in the world, why no more acceptable to most;</hi> this is the account, they do not ſee themſelves <hi>the chiefeſt of ſinners</hi> but the generality are either <hi>ſecure</hi> in <hi>ſin,</hi> or elſe <hi>resting</hi> upon ſome <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo Chriſt is not <hi>valued</hi> or <hi>accepted.</hi>

                  <p>III. <hi>Take hence one ground of the Saints patience, under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and calumnies of the world:</hi> you can ſcarce think ſo ill of them, as they do of themſelves; and therefore though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them not from you, and your accuſation is falſe, yet they can ſee God juſt in opening your mouthes to reproach them; as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>curſing Shimei, 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 10, 11. and ſo of <hi>ſcoffing Michal, 2 Sam. 6. 22, I will yet be more vile.</hi> In this Chriſtians imitate their Saviour, who, when he was reviled, anſwered not again. <hi>Paul</hi> was eſteemed a <hi>babler,</hi> a <hi>mad-man,</hi> a <hi>murtherer, not worthy to live;</hi> yet he gloried in all <hi>reproaches,</hi> and acknowledged himſelf <hi>the chief of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>See hence both the power, and the freeneſs of the grace of God,</hi> which ſo ſuddenly made the <hi>wolf</hi> a <hi>lamb;</hi> the <hi>chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> the <hi>greateſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> You can imagine no <hi>deſert,</hi> or <hi>meritorious preparation</hi> in a <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> and <hi>perſecutour,</hi> to the grace of God; himſelf attributes it onely to <hi>mercy,</hi> verſ. 13, 14. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 13, 15.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>See the infinite and unſearchable abyſs of divine wiſdome,</hi> that makes a <hi>perſecutour</hi> a <hi>preacher,</hi> and he who formerly <hi>blaſphemed</hi> his name, now a <hi>choſen veſſel</hi> to <hi>bear</hi> his name before the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Kings, Acts</hi> 9. 13. This is beſt reſolved into Gods <hi>abſoluteneſs,</hi> who makes uſe of whom he will. Though it may be he choſe his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſome of <hi>great ſinners, ut non tam voce, quàm exemplo conciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur de gratuita remiſsione peccatorum,</hi> as <hi>Aegidius</hi> notes, <hi>That they might preach free-grace by their Examples, as well as Sermons.</hi> As the people ſaid of the other <hi>Saul</hi> the King, 1 Sam. 10. 11. <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> ſo may we of this <hi>Saul, Is he among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? O the depth of the wiſdome of God!</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33.</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>Let us all then look after this particular faith,</hi> whereby we may receive Chriſt; reſt not upon this <hi>general belief,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners in the groſs;</hi> thou mayeſt <hi>periſh</hi> for all this; but <hi>apply</hi> Chriſt particularly to <hi>thy</hi> ſelf, as <hi>Thomas, My Lord, and my God,</hi> Joh. 20. 28. and the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> Luke 1. 47. and S. <hi>Paul, Who loved me,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel will be but <hi>dry breaſts</hi> to thee, no comfort from them, if thou draweſt not from them by the <hi>mouth</hi> of a <hi>ſpecial</hi> faith: and to believe that Chriſt <hi>came to ſave ſinners,</hi> will be little comfort or advantage to you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by a particular relyance you reſt on Chriſt, and by a ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication receive him, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. and here, <hi>of whom I am chief;</hi> viz. of thoſe who flie to Chriſt for ſalvation, and to whom this is <hi>an acceptable doctrine, That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am the chief.</hi>

That accurſed <hi>Machiavel</hi> allows a <hi>ſhadow</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> of Religion as uſefull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Magiſtrates, but the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>realitie</hi> pernicious. A <hi>principle</hi> perhaps ſuiting with the <hi>deſigns</hi> of a <hi>carnal Politician,</hi> but not of a <hi>Christian Magiſtrate,</hi> who lies under all poſſible <hi>obligations</hi> to the <hi>reality</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> If there were nothing elſe, the law of an <hi>ingenuous gratitude</hi> challengeth this, as conſidering that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But God is the Judge; he putteth down one, and ſetteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Pſal. 75. 6, 7. Therefore conſidering that <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. it muſt needs engage him to the pious ſervice of that God, from whom he derives his power. But, beſides this, there are many other weightie engagements to this <hi>real pietie;</hi> as the <hi>command</hi> of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. 10, 11. and the <hi>pious examples</hi> of good Magiſtrates. <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>man after Gods own heart, danced</hi> before the <hi>Ark, 2 Sam.</hi> 6. 20. Some think this<note place="margin">Acts 13. 22.</note> intimated, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 1. where <hi>Joſhua</hi> is called <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to note (ſaith <hi>Ferus</hi>) that none is fit to be a Magiſtrate and to <hi>rule
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57001:150"/> others</hi> by his laws, but he, who hath firſt learned <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>law of God; Niſi qui priùs legi Dei ſe ſubjecerit.</hi> Add to theſe the <hi>titles</hi> Scripture gives to Magiſtrates, who are called <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82. 1. They have the ſtampe of his authority, and ſhould therefore bear the image of his holineſs. They are called <hi>Fathers,</hi> Job 25. 16. which is <hi>Nomen pietatis &amp; poteſtatis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian:</hi> an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to piety as well as a title of authoritie; and ſpeakes their duty to be above the people in holineſs as well as honour, in goodneſs as well as greatneſs. Beſides, piety and Religion is neceſſary in a Magiſtrate, that he may (as he ought) rule in the fear of God, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. This will make him juſt to others, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in himſelf, faithfull in the diſcharge of his calling and particular truſt, conſcientious in his actions: and it will keep Magiſtracie from degenerating into Tyranny, command the peoples obedience, and beget in them reverence and awfull reſpects to their Superiours, and promote the happineſs and ſecurity of Government; moſt of which you have excellently expreſſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 10. Beſides, there is no ſuch cement and ſure tie of affections and love between Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and people, as Religion is: none ſo fit to rule others as thoſe, in whoſe ſouls piety and the fear of God rules and beares ſway. Obſerve what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith to the people, <hi>Deut. 1. 13. Take ye wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and underſtanding, and known among your tribes;</hi> known for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and <hi>the fear of God.</hi> The great duty of Magiſtrates is to appear againſt, and diſcountenance ſin in others, which an ungodly Magiſtrate will never do to the purpoſe. Nothing makes publick perſons more fearfull to appear againſt ſin in others, (whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in reproving, or Magiſtrates in puniſhing) then guilt at home, fearing leſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 2. 1. wherein they judge others, they ſhould condemn themſelves, ſeeing they themſelves do the ſame things.</hi> But if all this prevail not, if neither the honour of God, nor their own good; yet tenderneſs and pity to the people under them ſhould prevail upon them to be religious, leſt their ſins involve the people in publick miſery, as the ſins of Magiſtrates oft do: <hi>Quicquid delirant Reges,</hi> &amp;c. Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand of the people died for <hi>Davids</hi> ſin in numbring them, 2. Sam. 24. 15. Therefore if Magiſtrates regard either Gods glory, their own happineſs, or their peoples ſafety, they muſt write after <hi>Joſhuaes</hi> copy, viz. piety towards God. That is the firſt: as parts of, or helps to this piety,</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>His diligent ſtudy of the word of God.</hi> For queſtionleſs, what was Gods command to him was his practiſe, and that ye may ſee, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. 8. An excellent employment, a moſt proper exerciſe for a Chriſtian Magiſtrate; which therefore we have under the divine
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57001:151"/> command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19. The Magiſtrates power is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and arbitary, but limited and contracted; and the exerciſe of this power ſhould be anſwerable to, and regulated by the rule of the word of God: not by emergencies of State, or the like, but by the word. Their laws are unjuſt, their power is pernicious, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands tyrannical; if the one enact, or the other impoſe a thing contrary to the word. It was the juſt commendation of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> king of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that <hi>he converſed much with the word of God,</hi> which he peruſed <hi>ten times</hi> over with a <hi>Comment.</hi> It is the Magiſtrates du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to maintain and propagate the true worſhip and ſervice of God, as I ſhall ſhew more anon. But how to diſtinguiſh the <hi>true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God from <hi>idolatry</hi> or <hi>ſuperſtitious worſhip</hi> can be known onely by the <hi>word</hi> of God, in which God hath laid down a platform and Idea of the true manner how he will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Prayer and devotion to God.</hi> God when he gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> his charge, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 2. bad him <hi>Ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Surge. Videtur Joſhua in oratione jacuiſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ferus</hi> upon the place. <hi>Proſtration</hi> was then the uſual poſture of <hi>prayer.</hi> A duty well becoming a Chriſtian Magiſtrate; which <hi>David</hi> knew well, and therefore reſolves <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and morning,</hi> and <hi>at noon</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>cry aloud unto God,</hi> Pſal. 55. 17.

Magiſtrates ſhould be men of knowledge and underſtanding; as it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>he was wiſe as an Angel of God, 2 Sam. 14. 20. Moſes</hi> bid the people ſeek out <hi>men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> to be <hi>Rulers</hi> over them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. The way to come by this wiſdome is <hi>prayer:</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſenſible of, when being put to his choiſe what to ask, he prayed for <hi>wiſdome, 1 King</hi> 3. 9. The ſame his father <hi>David</hi> had prayed for for him before, 1 <hi>Chron. 22. 12. The Lord give thee wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> both to govern thy ſelf and others.

A Lions heart upholds the Magiſtrates power and authoritle; whileſt a baſe puſillanimous cowardize betraies his Government to <hi>contempt,</hi> his perſon to <hi>reproach,</hi> and encourageth the people (whileſt through his cowardize they promiſe themſelves impunitie) to <hi>confidence</hi> in ſin &amp; prophaneneſs.

On the contrary, a Magiſtrates religious example provokes piety in others.

There may perhaps be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe in that expreſſion, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2. 23. where God ſaith of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> that <hi>he will make him as a ſeal,</hi> or <hi>a ſignet,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the care and account God makes of good Magiſtrates, as men do of a Ring or Seal, he hath them continually in his hand; ſee, what an impreſſion Great-ones may make upon the people, and how readily the people will receive that Signature and impreſſion of Holineſs, which they ſee engraven upon their Governours and Superiours. This then may engage Magiſtrates to Holineſs, that they may go before others in a holy life. It was the honour of that <hi>Romane Ceſar,</hi> that he was never heard to ſay, <hi>Ite Milites,</hi> but <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Commilitones.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A moſt prevalent courſe: for this makes the people conceive of the Magiſtrates commands as equal and reaſonable, when they ſee Holineſs and Religion, not onely enacted by their laws, but legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their lives.</p>
                  <p>That's the firſt.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>By puniſhing ſin.</hi> Herein appeared <hi>Joſhua's</hi> zeal, in cauſing <hi>Achan</hi> to be ſtoned, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7. 25. This is part of the Commiſſion God hath given you; to this end he hath put a Sword into your hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 6. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. Magiſtrates ſhould puniſh ſin without fear or favour, by <hi>an impartial execution</hi> of the Laws, as for <hi>Sabbath breaking</hi> (a reigning ſin) <hi>ſwearing, drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Nor be <hi>Gallioes,</hi> when theſe ſins are brought before you, <hi>You care for none of theſe things,</hi> Acts 18. 17. Magiſtrates ſhould be zealous in puniſhing <hi>Firſt-Table-ſins;</hi> for the <hi>Second-Table-ſins,</hi> ſuch as Thefts, Murders, and the like, are the iſſue and birth of <hi>Atheiſme, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking,</hi> &amp;c. as, I ſuppoſe, you have heard men, when brought to ſuffer (then we may judge them moſt ſerious) crying out of their Sabbath-breaking, as that which brought them to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus a Magiſtrate may promote the ſervice of God, by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irreligion and Profaneneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. <hi>By countenancing and encouraging the godly; viz.</hi> thoſe who deſire to <hi>walk ſtrictly with,</hi> and attend the <hi>publick ſervice and Ordinances of God.</hi> Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 101. 6. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>By upholding the publick worſhip of God, and bringing the people to the publick Ordinances.</hi> Thus did <hi>Joſhua,</hi> if we credit <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:57001:154"/> who gives this as the reaſon, why wickedneſs prevailed ſo much after <hi>Joſhua's</hi> death, <hi>Quia poſt Joſhuam miniſterium collapſum erat.</hi> Then the Ordinances and Miniſtry were neglected; upon which followed Atheiſme, and contempt of God, and that let in an inundation of Profaneneſs. I know Religion is an act of the minde and ſoul, and ſo not liable to any outward reſtraint, but is onely ſubject to him, who hath an abſolute command and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie over the conſcience: but conformitie to an <hi>outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> may be commanded by a Superiour, without any Tyrannie over conſcience, or infringement of Chriſtian libertie. I know the Spirit of God can onely put them in, but, I believe, it is the Magiſtrates dutie and charge to ſee them brought to the pool.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>By protecting and countenancing the Miniſtry of the word of God, and the publick preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> Magiſtrates are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Gates</hi> in Scripture, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 11. intimating their dutie to <hi>let in,</hi> and give a <hi>paſſage</hi> to the Goſpel. Then the Church and State is like to flouriſh, ſin diſcountenanced, Religion propagated, when<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Read Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, l. 1. c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> go hand in hand together; the Magiſtrate to correct ſin, the Miniſter to reprove; when the Magiſtrate makes uſe of the Miniſters direction, and the Miniſter enjoys the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates protection. It is ſaid of good king <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> that <hi>he ſent princes to teach in the cities of Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. 7. not that they did publickly diſpenſe the word; for they had Levites with them, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and they <hi>taught,</hi> verſe 6. But they were ſent to <hi>provide for,</hi> and <hi>countenance</hi> the Levites in that office; and this is certainly the Chriſtian Magiſtrates duty, to protect the Miniſters of the Goſpel,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>In their repute and credit:</hi> leſt the Goſpel come to be ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as we have found by lamentable experience; that, ſince the Embaſſadours of the Goſpel have been diſreſpected, and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries of ignorant men caſt upon them to cloud their credit; the Goſpel hath been undervalued, errours multiplied, the Scriptures queſtioned and vilified: and, I fear, the Magiſtrates will ſcarce waſh their hands from much guilt of all this.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>In their maintenance and just rights. Famem miniſtrorum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Fames verbi,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> long ſince foretold, <hi>That famiſhing the Miniſters would uſher in a Famine of the word.</hi> And if ever the maintenance of the Miniſtry comes to be arbitrary, we ſhould have none but <hi>Micha's</hi> Levites, who ſerve for ten <hi>ſhekels</hi> by the year, and <hi>a ſuit of apparel,</hi> and his <hi>victuals.</hi> This is Scripture, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 10. And if you mark the circumſtance of the ſtory, it was when there was <hi>noking in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. And that will befall the Miniſters,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57001:154"/> which God threatned as a curſe upon <hi>Elie's</hi> houſe, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 36. And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is left in thine houſe ſhall come and crouch to him for a piece of ſilver, and a morſel of bread, and ſhall ſay, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the Priests offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</hi> Would you account him a friend to the <hi>childe,</hi> that ſhould ſtarve the <hi>nurſe,</hi> that ſhe can give no <hi>milk</hi> to it? no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friends are they (pretend what they will) who would <hi>ſtarve</hi> the Miniſters, and ſo <hi>rob</hi> the people of the <hi>ſincere milk of the word,</hi> by which they ſhould <hi>grow, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. This Scripture ſpeaks of as the badge of <hi>bad</hi> Magiſtrates. A perſecuting <hi>Ahab,</hi> that counted <hi>Elijah</hi> the <hi>troubler of Iſrael, 1 Kings</hi> 18. (the language of too many now adays) and thoſe ungodly Princes, who caſt <hi>Jeremy</hi> into the <hi>dungeon,</hi> Jer. 37. 15. Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was of another ſpirit and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. See his remarkable <hi>zeal, 2 Chron.</hi> 31. 2. that the people might not want the ſervice of God: and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he orders the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> maintenance, that they might neither want <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence</hi> nor <hi>encouragement.</hi> A <hi>good pattern</hi> for <hi>good</hi> Magiſtrates, who deſire to promote the <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>By building or repairing the places of Gods worſhip and ſervice.</hi> Thus we finde <hi>David</hi> both by his example and entreaty prepare for the <hi>building</hi> of the <hi>Temple, 1 Chron.</hi> 29. 2, 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> building it. It was <hi>Davids</hi> trouble, and that which he looked upon as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that he ſhould live in an <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Cedars,</hi> and the <hi>Ark of God</hi> remain within <hi>curtains, 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 2. Thus <hi>Joas, 2 King. 12. 5, 6, 7, 8. Joſiah, 2 King.</hi> 22. 3, 4, 5. took care for repairing it. And it ſpoke the <hi>pious</hi> care of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that after the Church was come out of thoſe ten furious perſecutions, he cauſed the <hi>Idol Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to be ſhut up, and the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> demoliſhed by <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> to be reedified. And this piece of promoting the ſervice of God you are not ignorant how your Magiſtrate, now in being, hath imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in reedifying that place of worſhip formerly famous for <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> and others; which as you cannot without ingratitude but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as a teſtimony of his affection to your <hi>town</hi> (thus they argued of their <hi>centurion</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Luke 7. 5. For he loveth our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he hath built us a Synagogue</hi>) ſo we cannot without uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs but apprehend it, as a good preſage of his future <hi>zeal</hi> in his Government for promoting and upholding the <hi>true worſhip</hi> and ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>VII, And laſtly, <hi>The influence</hi> of a good Magiſtrate will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider <hi>the ſad effects of the want of Magistracy.</hi> For which I ſhall lead you no further then this Church of the <hi>Jews:</hi> read at your leiſure the five laſt Chapters of this book of <hi>Judges,</hi> where you may ſee the ſinfull and miſerable eſtate of the Jews, when there
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57001:155"/> was <hi>no King in Iſrael;</hi> not onely outrages and filthy abominations abounding, as the abuſing of the <hi>Levites Concubine</hi> unto death, Chap. 19.

                     <hi>His ſcarlet made him a Magiſtrate, not a Miniſter.</hi> Theſe are acts of <hi>office</hi> and belonging to Miniſters, as a <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>diſtinct function</hi> from Magiſtracy. Therefore for them to engage in theſe, is but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to be <hi>buſy bodies</hi> in other mens matters. But</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Their charge is to uphold the Ordinances, and to propagate and countenance the publick worſhip of the true God, and preaching of his word. Jehoiadah,</hi> when he anointed <hi>Joaſh,</hi> gave him the <hi>Book of the law</hi> to keep, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 12. as minding him of his duty in taking care for <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>worſhip of God.</hi> This is that which was propheſied of <hi>Goſpel-times, Eſay. 49. 23. Kings ſhall be thy Nurſing-Fathers, and their Queens thy Nurſing-Mothers,</hi> &amp;c. And in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing all falſe worſhip of God. This hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſe, and the deſerved glory and praiſe of good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: as it was the glory of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that he ſent out <hi>Levites</hi> to preach in Judah, and Princes to protect and countenance them: as you read, 2 <hi>Chron. 17. 7, 8. Non enim uſurpârunt ſibi functionem alienam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lavater.</hi> Therefore they did not preach; but through<note place="margin">Lavater. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> the <hi>zeal</hi> of that good Magiſtrate were ſent to provide, that the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57001:155"/> word of God might be upheld by the civil authority. So he that ſhall read, 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 23. will evidently ſee <hi>Joſiahs</hi> care for <hi>Religion</hi> in his deſtroying <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and providing for <hi>the teaching of the law. Hezekiah</hi> provides for <hi>the keeping of the Paſsover, 2 Chron. 30. 1. Darius</hi> makes a <hi>publick edict,</hi> that <hi>the God of Daniel onely ſhould be worſhipped,</hi> Dan. 6. 26. And, to name no more, <hi>Joſhua</hi> here: what care did he take for <hi>the worſhip of God?</hi> See, how he exhorts the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 14. And this is the duty of every good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate upon a fourfold account.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>To ſecure the peoples obedience.</hi> Obſerve how <hi>ready an obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence</hi> the people gave to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1. 17. <hi>According as we heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto Moſes in all things, ſo we will hearken unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I think, there is no more effectual means to keep the people in <hi>obedience,</hi> then to uphold the <hi>Ordinances.</hi> For the word of God, where it <hi>converts</hi> not, it oft <hi>civilizeth,</hi> and layes a reſtraint and curbe upon mens Spirits. It takes cognizance of, and reproves, and cenſures thoſe ſins (inward <hi>lurking ſins</hi>) which the <hi>civil ſword</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach. <hi>Si vis omnia tibi ſubjicere, ſubjice rationi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca:</hi>

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>How ſhall they ever keep their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to me, who have already caſt off their religion to God.</hi> And our own ſad experience tells us (he is wilfully blinde, that ſees it not) that the Magiſtrates have no greater enemies, then thoſe, who have thrown off the <hi>publick Ordinances</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, and are crept into houſes. Their pretence is againſt the Miniſtry, but they are enemies to the Magiſtracy. As I am informed, ſome ſcattered papers have been in this Town to that effect: and they can ſpit damnation in the Magiſtrates, as well as in the Miniſters faces. They pretend to be onely againſt bad Magiſtrates, and they would have the <hi>civil ſword</hi> onely in the hands of the <hi>Saints;</hi> but then the next thing is, they muſt be accounted the onely <hi>Saints;</hi> ſo that the deſign is, either no Magiſtracy at all, or elſe they are the onely <hi>Saints</hi> (forſooth) muſt have it.

                  <p>4. <hi>To preſerve their own glory, repute, and honour.</hi> Thus was our <hi>good</hi> Magiſtrate in the Text <hi>glorious</hi> in the <hi>eyes</hi> of all the people, <hi>Joſh,</hi> 3. 7. and 4. 14. This is it which good Magiſtrates have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gloried in.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Application</hi> ſhall onely be briefly this: Let both people and Magiſtrate from all this learn their duty. Hath the Magiſtrate ſuch an influence upon, and charge over <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God? Then let the people learn a three-fold dutie to Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Of prayer for them.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> foretells as part of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Solomons</hi> government, that <hi>prayer ſhall continually be made for him,</hi> Pſal. 72. 15. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews that it was the conſtant practiſe<note place="margin">

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57001:157"/> Imperatore; Send theſe Chriſtian ſouls to heaven breathing out prayers for their perſecuting Emperour.</hi> And how much rather is it our duty to pray for thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who ſtand up for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and protection of the true worſhip of God? This is the uſe the Apoſtle makes of it, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1, 2. I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſsions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: For Kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honesty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Of honour and reverence.</hi> Rom. 13. 7. <hi>Honour</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to whom honour is due;</hi> as being the Ordination of God, bearing the image of his authority; as alſo becauſe of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which God derives unto us by them as inſtruments. Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain honourable thoughts of them, as ſet over you not by chance, but providence; and though by man as the inſtrument (in which reſpect the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo ſhould we, if we rightly conſidered the miſerie of the want, or the happineſs of enjoying good Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Of ſubjection and obedience.</hi> This is the Apoſtles direct inference; <hi>Rom. 13. 1. Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> &amp;c. But why? <hi>firſt,</hi> For his authority and greatneſs, verſ. 4. He is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>ſecondly,</hi> For his uſefulneſs: it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>It is to thee for good;</hi> not onely for thy outward civil good, but for thy ſpiritual and eternal good; for thy natural good, protecting thy life; for thy moral good, by wholeſome laws reſtraining thee from ſin; thy civil good, in ſecuring thy outward enjoyments and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; and thy ſpiritual good, while he upholds and propagates the preaching of the word, and the exerciſe of religion: thus <hi>Paraeus</hi> gloſſeth. And are they not prevailing arguments of our ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How doth Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> charge and reprove thoſe, who pretend their Chriſtian liberty (as many do now adays) as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from obedience and ſubjection to the civil pwer, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>verſ.</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:57001:157"/> 16. <hi>As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of Maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</hi> As is he had ſaid, <hi>Uſe your liberty, but not to diſobedience.</hi> Yet by way of caution let me add; Your obedience to them and ſubjection muſt be limited and reſtrained to thoſe commands, which are agreeing to, or not contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; for to ſuch commands you owe the Magiſtrate no obedience. The <hi>three children</hi> refuſe obedience to the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>bowing to the golden image,</hi> Dan. 3. 18. And Scripture ſpeaks of it as an <hi>Act of faith</hi> in the <hi>Midwives,</hi> to diſobey the Kings command of <hi>killing all the male children,</hi> Exod. 1. 17. &amp; Heb. 11. 23. <hi>Daniel</hi> prayes three times a day, notwithſtanding the <hi>edict</hi> to the contrary, <hi>Dan. 6. 10. Sauls</hi> ſervants refuſe his wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in <hi>killing the Prieſts of the</hi> Lord, 1 <hi>Sam. 22. 17. Ideò magnus eſt, quia coelo minor,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> We muſt ſo give <hi>to Ceſar the things that are Ceſars,</hi> that we reſerve <hi>to God the things that are Gods,</hi> Matth. 22. 21. In other things the Apoſtles reſolution muſt be ours, Acts 4. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hence, Magiſtrates, ſee your <hi>charge,</hi> and learn your <hi>dutie;</hi> no light or eaſie one. It is not onely the Crown upon your heads, but the Government upon your ſhoulders. <hi>The earth is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; I bear up the pillars of it,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 75. 3. Joyn you your ſhoulders to uphold it; joyn hand in hand together (I wiſh the Magiſtrates of both bodies would do it) to diſcountenance <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs,</hi> to uphold the <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>publick Ordinances,</hi> to the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſin; and let not any <hi>ſelf-intereſts</hi> or animoſities <hi>break</hi> your <hi>ſtrength,</hi> or <hi>weaken</hi> your <hi>hands</hi> in acting for God and for Religion. Let me inforce this upon you by a threefold conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I. Conſider, <hi>from whom you have your power.</hi> It is <hi>from God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. <hi>For there is no power but of God,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Pſal. 82. 6. I have ſaid ye are gods, and all of you are children of the moſt High:</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as it ſpeaks that tender fatherly regard God hath to good Magiſtrates, as fathers to their children; ſo it ſpeaks participation, that they derive all from God, as a ſon hath all from his father: therefore it is but equitie, that you ſhould employ that power, which you have received from his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> to his <hi>glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Conſider, <hi>from whom you receive enablements, to put this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in execution.</hi> God as he gives you the power, ſo he muſt enable you to execute it. It was God that gave <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſdome in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his prayer, (<hi>Solomon</hi> knew from whom he muſt have it) to <hi>go in and out</hi> before the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 10, 12.</p>
                  <p>III. Conſider, <hi>to whom you muſt be accountable for it.</hi> It is not onely a power, but a talent and truſt God hath put into your hands; and he will one day call you to account for it: then what a terrible
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57001:158"/> word will that be to a wicked Magiſtrate, <hi>Luke 16. 2. And he called him, and ſaid unto him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayſt be no longer ſteward.</hi> He that had improved his Talent, appeared chearfully before his Lord to give an account of it; ſo may you, if by protecting Religion and diſcountenancing ſin you improve your Talent of Authoritie for your Maſter's glorie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 16.</p>
                  <p>And for your ſelf (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Major</hi>) it being your choiſe to authorize me to be your <hi>Remembrancer</hi> this day, I ſhall end all with a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application</hi> to you. Remember you are in a place of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doing God ſervice: do you, if others neglect it, (though I hope the reſt of your Brethren will friendly go along with you, and put the ſhoulder to the work) ſtand up for Religion and the ſervice of God; do not look upon your ſelf onely, as entruſted by the Town, for the preſerving its peace, and immunities, and priviledges, but as entruſted and empowered by God for the good of the Church, and to keep up Religion in the Town; which that you may chearfully and couragiouſly go through, I ſhall hint unto you theſe motives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The care of Religion,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Will make your Government proſperous.</hi> So God tells <hi>Joſhua,</hi> chap. 1. 8. <hi>This book of the law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayſt obſerve to do according unto all that is written therein: For then thou ſhalt make thy ways proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> told <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 2. 3. <hi>And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that thou mayſt proſper in all that thou doſt, and whitherſoever thou tarneſt thy ſelf.</hi> Uphold Religion, it will ſecure you, 1 <hi>Chron. 22. 13. Then ſhalt thou proſper, if thou takeſt heed to fulfill the Statutes and judgements, which the Lord charged Moſes with concerning Iſrael.</hi> Thus <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 18. 6, 7. <hi>For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from following him, but kept his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Lord commanded Moſes. And the Lord was with him, and he proſpered whitherſoever be went forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>It will make your life honourable, and perpetuate a good name to you;</hi> which is better then precious oyntment. So ſaith the <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Prov. 4. 8. <hi>Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee: ſhe ſhall bring thee to honour when thou doſt embrace her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Your death comfortable.</hi> It is a fit meditation for a Magiſtrate to think of death. <hi>Alexander</hi> had one to be his conſtant <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer</hi> of this: and the Pſalmiſt puts the <hi>gods of the earth</hi> in minde of it, <hi>Pſal. 82. 6, 7. But ye ſhall die like men, and fall like on of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Now this will ſweeten death to reflect upon our faithfulneſs in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57001:158"/> our particular callings. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had <hi>finiſhed his courſe,</hi> and <hi>kept the faith,</hi> could deſire to be diſſolved. <hi>Moſes,</hi> a faithfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, zealous for God, and againſt Idolatrie (with what courage did he cauſe the Calf to be burned?) the Jews ſay of him, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ad oſculum oris Dei, at the kiſſes of Gods mouth, and in divine embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> How comfortably did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> reflect upon this on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>Eſay. 38. 3. And he ſaid, Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> Thus happie ſhall you be both in life and death, if you make it your care, what was <hi>Joſhua's</hi> here in the Text, that as they did all his days, ſo all your days <hi>the people may ſerve the Lord.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three things, that may ſecure Chriſtians from being ſcandalized at, or ſeduced by the Errours, and Hereſies of theſe times.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Scripture hath clearly foretold there muſt be ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That theſe are but the revivings of thoſe Hereſies, which have been in all ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Scripture affords us plentifull proviſion of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confute them.</p>
                  <p>And to inſtance in that one Hereſie, or blaſphemie of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> denying <hi>the Divinitie of Christ.</hi> We ſhall finde it was foretold by the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1. (denying the Lord that bought them</hi>) and condemned of old by the Fathers, and Councels, in <hi>Samoſatenus, Photinus, Arius, Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and others: and laſtly, the Scripture abundantly ſilenced this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaſphemie, eſpecially by S. <hi>John,</hi> both in his Epiſtles, and Goſpel. In his firſt Epiſtle, where, by his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. his <hi>many Antichriſts,</hi> he means <hi>Marcion, Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and ſuch like. And in his Goſpel, which in the judgement of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and divers others of the Ancients, was written on purpoſe againſt the blaſphemie of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> the predeceſſours and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our late <hi>Socinians.</hi> And to evince this (To omit the firſt chapter, which is ſo clear a teſtimonie of the God-head of Chriſt, that <hi>Junius</hi> confeſſes, he was converted from Atheiſme to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Chriſt by his reading of it) I need travel no further then the context of this chapter, wherein my preſent Text lies, where our bleſſed Saviour diſputing againſt the Jews, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates himſelf to be the <hi>true Meſsiah,</hi> and ſo conſequently <hi>true God,</hi> by a four fold teſtimonie.</p>
                  <p>I. Of <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> whom the Jews were obliged to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had before ſent to him, to enquire of Chriſt, <hi>v. 33. Ye ſent unto John, and he bare witneſs of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:57001:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>II. Of <hi>his own works and miracles;</hi> which evidently argued the <hi>arm</hi> of <hi>omnipotencie</hi> to effect them, at <hi>verſe 36. The works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. Of <hi>the Father,</hi> at <hi>verſe 37. The Father himſelf which hath ſent me, hath born witneſs of me; viz.</hi> that very teſtimony which the Father gave of the Son, at his being baptized, in <hi>Mat. 3. 17. This is my well-beloved Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. Of <hi>Scripture,</hi> here in the Text, which though it be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by our Saviour, as the <hi>laſt,</hi> yet is not to be accounted of as the <hi>leaſt teſtimony,</hi> as we ſhall ſee in the further handling of them. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The words therefore, for the better handling of them, we ſhall conſider two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Relatively,</hi> as they ſtand to the <hi>context.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> as conſidered by <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Relatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus conſidered, they are an argument to prove the God-head, and Office of Chriſt, which was denied and rejected by the Jews. And this he puts laſt, that he might vindicate his Doctrine from the ſuſpicion and imputation of <hi>novelty:</hi> and alſo, and that more eſpecially, becauſe all the former teſtimonies lay expoſed to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and exceptions of the Jews: as thus,</p>
                  <p>Againſt <hi>the teſtimony of John</hi> the objection was obvious, that <hi>he was one ſent, and ſuborned by Chriſt,</hi> and therefore his teſtimony ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Againſt <hi>his working of miracles,</hi> they could eaſily anſwer, as ſometimes they did, that <hi>he caſt out devils by Beelzebub.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt <hi>the teſtimonie of the Father from heaven,</hi> it was as eaſie to cavil, and ſay, that <hi>it was but a phantaſie and deluſion,</hi> a <hi>deceptio ſensûs, or,</hi> perhaps, <hi>a Satanical revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, when he appeals to the Scriptures, which the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledged, and were even <hi>ſuperſtitious ſearchers</hi> into, they could have nothing to cavil, or rationally to object: therefore he ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, <hi>If,</hi> or, <hi>although you will not believe any of the former teſtimonies, yet, ſure I am, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from hence the obſervation is this,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>Scripture teſtimony is the moſt certain, and infallible ground and evidence of ſaving truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More certain then Humane teſtimonie, then Miracles, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                  <p>And this may be cleared by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:57001:161"/>
                  <p>I. It is more certain then <hi>Humane teſtimonie;</hi> for</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Scripture teſtimonie</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to be credited, and believed for it ſelf,</hi> upon account of that Divine authoritie it brings with it. It was a blinde reverence that <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s ſcholars gave him; whoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was ſufficient to command their aſſent to, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whatſoever he taught them. This is that we ow to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; what it ſpeaks, we muſt receive as the voice of God: for ſo it is, if we credit the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr. 1. 1. God ſpake unto us ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies,</hi> &amp;c: No humane teſtimony can be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: becauſe the beſt of men are fallible, ſubject to errour in judgement, or to be perverted by paſſion, or intereſt of wrath, or to ſpeak contrarie to truth; therefore I believe no humane writing, but what brings ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to my reaſon, and ſuſpend my aſſent till I meet with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conviction: but in <hi>Scripture-teſtimony,</hi> though I meet with no other ſatisfaction to my reaſon, then this, that <hi>God hath ſaid it,</hi> I give my aſſent and belief to it. And thus the Prophets of old uſed no other arguments to perſwade what they delivered, then, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> Divine teſtimony is above all exception, and to be believed for it ſelf; not becauſe of the ſuffrage of the Church, nor the conſent and approbation of reaſon; for this were to exalt Humane teſtimony above Divine, and the dictates of a fallible reaſon, above the infallible revelations of God, and to ſet that in <hi>the throne,</hi> which God would have us captivate and ſubdue, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. The aſſent we ow to Humane teſtimonies upon ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conviction, is an aſſent of ſcience and demonſtration; but the aſſent I ow to Scripture teſtimony, is an aſſent of faith, grounded onely upon Divine revelation, which is to be believed, though the the teſtimonie of all the world, and the ſeeming plauſible pretences of reaſon ſhould contradict it. As the myſterie of the <hi>Trinity, Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Reſurrection,</hi> and the like, are to <hi>reaſon</hi> ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet to be believed upon the account of Scripture teſtimony; in which the ultimate reſolution of our faith ought to be made not into the <hi>fallible evidences</hi> of reaſon, or the <hi>erring dictates</hi> of men. If you finde a <hi>ſcriptum eſt, Let God be true though all men be liars,</hi> Rom. 3. 4.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe of <hi>that conſent and harmony that is in Scripture testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi> no jarring or contradiction in it; but what <hi>the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, the Evangeliſts ſpeak of,</hi> is fulfilled. In <hi>humane writings</hi> how frequently may we obſerve one contradicting another, and this reaſon claſhing with that? Nay, the ſame authour through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or forgetfulneſs inconſiſtent to himſelf: but in Scripture, there is a full and perfect conſent, as all proceeding from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of the ſame infallible ſpirit, as in 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57001:162"/> given by inſpiration of God,</hi> &amp;c. and 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. For the propheſie came not in old times by the will of man; but Holy men of God ſpake, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And though there may ſeem ſometimes to be ſome contradictions, and inconſiſtences; yet theſe ariſe not from the Scripture it ſelf, but from our ſhortneſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ignorance, and the like: therefore we ſay what our Saviour ſaith at verſ. 46. of this chapter, <hi>Had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me:</hi> and, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Apologie</hi> for himſelf, <hi>Act. 26. 22. Saying none other things then thoſe, which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come.</hi> A ſweet conſent there is between <hi>Chriſt, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Becauſe <hi>Scripture was given to this very end to be a certain and infallible ground of truth:</hi> for though God, during the <hi>infancy</hi> of the Church, while it was incloſed in ſome few families, revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by <hi>viſions,</hi> and communicated his will from hand to hand by <hi>tradition,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>extraordinary revelation;</hi> yet, when the Church increaſed, and the people grew more corrupt and inclining to the <hi>heathen Idolatry,</hi> God gave the <hi>law</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo ſucceſſively by the Prophets and Apoſtles, by whom it pleaſed God to reveal his minde and will to all in writing, both <hi>that it might be the better conveyed unto poſterity,</hi> as we finde it in <hi>Pſal. 102. 18. This ſhall be written for the generation to come:</hi> and <hi>the more eaſily ſecured from corruption.</hi> Had God ſtill conveyed it unto us by the way of <hi>tradition:</hi> either through the unfaithfulneſs of mans memory, or his being ſubject to errour, or affectation of novelty, it had been laid open to a multitude of corruptions, which if (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhewes us) ſcarce prevented by the penning of it, how much leſs, if it never had been written? And alſo, <hi>that the Church might have an exact ſtandard of faith, &amp; a perfect rule, and an infallible judge of truth,</hi> and therefore Epheſ. 2. 20. <hi>The Church</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf being the <hi>chief corner ſtone. Faith</hi> builds ſurer here then upon the <hi>testimony</hi> of the Prophets, and Apoſtles. And this S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us expreſly was his reaſon of writing the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>That thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things,</hi> &amp;c. And thus more certain then <hi>Humane testimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. More certain then <hi>miracles:</hi> for though it pleaſed God at firſt to confirm the truth of the Goſpel by miracles to the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Adverſaries, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpeaks to our Saviour, in <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. Yet now, God having compleated the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture, and warned us, not to <hi>receive any other doctrine, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould bring it,</hi> Galat. 1. 8. and pronounced a <hi>wo</hi> upon all thoſe, <hi>who ſhould add or detract from it,</hi> Revelat. 22. 18.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57001:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> if any ſhould bring any doctrine contrary to Scripture, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of confirming it by wonders, and miracles, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as erroneous and Antichriſtian: and ſo we ſee the Apoſtle makes this one of the badges of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>III. More certain then <hi>Revelations.</hi> There is a place, that I have oft thought of, it is in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. A true voice of God from heaven of his ſon Chriſt: yet the Apoſtle tells us, that we may more infalliblely finde Chriſt in <hi>in the word of Propheſie,</hi> (what that is, he tells us ver. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) then by extraordinary reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Revelations we acknowledge, viz. of the ſpirit reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and clearing up Goſpel-truth: and this is that the Apoſtle pray'd for in behalf of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in <hi>Epheſ. 1. 16, 17, 18. I ceaſe not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: that the God of our Lord Jeſus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdome, and revelation in the knowledge of him,</hi> &amp;c. and thus Chriſt revealed the Scriptures to the diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45, 46. that they might underſtand them, but not that under that pretence of Revelation they ſhould reject, and lay them aſide. It is fond, and ungodly to pretend to Revelations, beſides or contrary to the Scripture. S <hi>Paul</hi> would have an <hi>Angel from heaven,</hi> if he brings it, to be <hi>accurſed,</hi> Galat. 1. 8. and what are they then, who receive them? Again he tells the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that he had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> unto them <hi>the whole councel of God, Acts</hi> 20. 27. and yet at <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. he profeſſes that he ſaid <hi>nothing but what Moſes and the Prophets had ſaid ſhould come:</hi> yet this S. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>rapt up into the third heaven,</hi> and there heard <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>unſpeakable words,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. There can be no ſecurity for our faith from Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unleſs they be ſuch as bring evidences and aſſurances that they are from God; for Satan can transform himſelf into <hi>an angel of light, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 14. Now how ſhall we diſtinguiſh Satans deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Revelations, but by the Teſtimony of the Scriptures, by which we are commanded to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> 1 John 4. 1. For theſe Revelations, and Enthuſiaſmes men pretend unto, are oft as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and inconſiſtent to themſelves, as they are all contrary to the truth; and therefore muſt be tryed by ſome infallible rule: otherwiſe we ſhall conſtantly lie expoſed to deluſion, unſetled in judgement, and irreſolved as to practiſe, as not knowing what the next revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be, perhaps quite contrary to the former. Wherefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, they who will not reſt upon the Scripture as the foundation of faith, can reſt no where. When the Rich man in the Goſpel would have had one extraordinary to have been ſent from the dead to his brethren: obſerve what anſwer <hi>Abraham</hi> gives him, <hi>Luke 16. 29, 30, 31. They have Moſes, and the Prophets, and if they hear not
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57001:163"/> them, neither will they hear, though one come from the dead.</hi> If one comes with Revelation, and tells me, It comes from God, he muſt convince me of the truth of it, or elſe I may with the ſame eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſay, It is from Satan: and this conviction can be made no otherwiſe but by Scripture, which is the moſt infallible ground of truth.</p>
                  <p>What the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, we may truly ſay of our late pretenders to <hi>Enthuſiaſmes</hi> and <hi>Revelations, We know not whence he is,</hi> John 9. 29. They may be from <hi>Rome</hi> (as it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſome of them are:) or whence ſoever they come, certainly not from God, if they diſown the voice of God in the Scriptures. Wherefore my counſel to you ſhall be that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, 2 Theſſal. 2. 2. Be not ſoon ſhaken in minde, nor be troubled:</hi> and in 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 18. Hold faſt the form of ſound words.</hi> And this will be uſefull thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Then <hi>make your laſt appeal to Scriptures in matters of faith.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> appeal to <hi>uncertain traditions,</hi> the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> to <hi>deluding Revelation;</hi> let us to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for this is both the precept of God, and the conſtant practiſe of the Scriptures: <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimonie,</hi> Eſay 8. 20. So our Bleſſed Saviour always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Scriptures, as in the buſineſs of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Matth. 22. 29. And to prove himſelf <hi>the Meſsiah,</hi> he appeals to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Luke 24. 26, 27. Thus the Apoſtles, though acted by the <hi>ſame infallible Spirit,</hi> yet always appealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>the Prophets:</hi> ſo did S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2. 25, 31. and from thence did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi> confute the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 29. and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> to prove the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 23. So then (<hi>my brethren</hi>) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal not to the judgement and teſtimony of man, what he ſaith: (as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was much delighted with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that he was wont to ſay, <hi>Da magiſtrum;</hi>) nor to the dictates of dark reaſon: but to the <hi>infallible Teſtimonie</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and attend to <hi>Gods voice</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>See here the ingenuous boldneſs and confidence of truth, that dares appeal to Scripture.</hi> Chriſt was confident of his cauſe, and therefore declines not the <hi>teſt</hi> of Scriptures: <hi>Search them,</hi> ſaith he; as if he had ſaid, <hi>If they do not testifie of me, then do not acknowledge me.</hi> It argues a timorous diffidence and conſciouſneſs of men, when they like not to be tried by the word of God; as in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> who appeals <hi>from the Scripture to traditions;</hi> and it ſpeaks the errours of thoſe <hi>Revelations,</hi> which will not ſubſcribe to be tried here: you may ſafely reject that doctrine as erroneous, which will not be <hi>weighed</hi> in the <hi>ballance</hi> of the Scriptures; or if it be weighed there, proves <hi>light</hi> and <hi>wanting. Tertullian</hi> of old notes, that <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:57001:163"/> were <hi>lucifugae Scripturarum.</hi> As <hi>blear eyes</hi> decline <hi>looking upon the ſun,</hi> ſo <hi>corrupt doctrines</hi> the <hi>light of the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Embrace and entertain nothing as ſaving truth, which will not bear the test of Scripture.</hi> It is one uſe of Scripture, to be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. to <hi>confute,</hi> and <hi>ſilence hereſie</hi> and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:</hi> and what-ever the Scripture reproves is ſuch. Be not impoſed upon by the proud imperious dictates of men, nor deluded by the pretences and deluſions of Satan, and his inſtruments; but let this be your rule to try by.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>In all your doubts conſult the Scriptures.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 24. He made the <hi>Testimonies of God</hi> his <hi>delight,</hi> and his <hi>counſellours</hi> to <hi>enform and reſolve him:</hi> and that, 1. <hi>In doubts of the head for reformation:</hi> this is one excellency of the Scriptures, to <hi>make wiſe the ſimple;</hi> as in <hi>Pſal. 19. 7. Scripture,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. is profitable to inform the judgement:</hi> and by this did <hi>David</hi> become <hi>wiſer then his teachers. 2. In doubts of the heart for conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That was one end of <hi>Goſpel-revelation,</hi> that <hi>we through patience and comfort of the Scripture might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. And ſo <hi>David</hi> found the <hi>ſtatutes of God,</hi> to be the <hi>rejoycing of his heart,</hi> Pſal. 19. 8.

Such a <hi>ſearcher of Scripture</hi> was <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 72. who prized <hi>the truth of God,</hi> more then <hi>thouſands of gold and ſilver:</hi> and ſuch a ſearcher was S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo, who ſays of himſelf, <hi>ſacrae Scripturae tuae ſunt ſanctae deliciae meae.</hi> And ſurely, the more a man ſearches into theſe mines, the more will he prize and value them, and he that theſe mines, the more will he prize and value them, and he that hath the ſpirit of God cannot certainly but prize thoſe Scriptures, even becauſe they come from him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God <hi>commmunicates himſelf</hi> in the ſearch of Scripture onely to <hi>the humble:</hi> he fills theſe <hi>emptie veſſels. Eliah</hi> bids the widow <hi>get emptie veſſels,</hi> that her <hi>oly might be multiplied,</hi> 2 Kings 4. 3. We muſt get veſſels <hi>emptie of pride</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceit,</hi> if we would have our ſpiritual knowledge encreaſed, for <hi>with the lowly is wiſdome,</hi> Prov. 11: 2.

Believe it for true, that, <hi>to know your ignorance is a good step to true and ſaving knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Without this humilitie we cannot entertain, and embrace Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</hi> Men puſt up with a proud conceit of their own knowledge have often proved greateſt enemies unto the Goſpel: hence it ſeemed at firſt <hi>to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. It ſeemed abſurd to their reaſon to expect <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> by a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching of the Goſpel ſeemed but babling to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurean,</hi> and <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts 17. 18. And they were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> men high and proud in their own donceits, which reject our Saviours perſon and doctrine. It is hard for men not to be puffed up with pride, and exalted above meaſure. <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelf was in danger of it. <hi>Galen</hi> rejected the coctrine and profeſſion of Chriſtianity, becauſe he could not meet with <hi>Mathematical demonſtrations</hi> to prove every thing in it, as he did in other ſciences. It is the grace of humilitie makes men to ſubmit to the <hi>ſimplicitie of the Goſpel: Receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word,</hi> James 1. 21. and it ſo received will help to ſave the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>The reverent trembling ſearcher,</hi> that, when he reads the Scripture, does it with an <hi>holy aw and reverence of that God,</hi> whoſe word it is, and of thoſe <hi>mysteries of life and ſalvation by Chriſt,</hi> which it diſcovers. This is the man God looks at: <hi>Iſaiah 66. 2. To him will I look that trembleth at my word.</hi> One that fears, leſt by his own phantaſies and ignorance he may miſinterpret Scripture, or <hi>wreſt it to his own, or other mens deſtructions.</hi> This holy fear becomes eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Miniſters of the Goſpel in their ſearch of Scripture, that they do not, as <hi>Spiders,</hi> ſuck poiſon out of thoſe flowers to the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and infecting of others. This does <hi>S. Paul</hi> urge upon <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf, and thy doctrine; that thou mayſt ſave both thy ſelf and others:</hi> intimating, that if he did not take heed, he might deſtroy both himſelf and others. Ye know how the <hi>Beth-ſhemites</hi> fared for their irreverent gazing into the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57001:168"/> Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. and ſo thou haſt cauſe to fear, who doeſt with an irreverent boldneſs ſearch into Scripture, without any <hi>awfull thoughts</hi> of the Majeſtie, and Myſteries of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> was to pull off the ſhoes off his feet, when he converſed with God, and heard his voice. When thou readeſt Scripture, thou haſt God ſpeaking unto thee; for it is <hi>his voice, Heb.</hi> 1. 1. and therefore come with <hi>reverent affections.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaies of ſpeaking, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 11. If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God;</hi> the ſame ſay I of <hi>ſearching</hi> into the Scriptures, and that beſpeaks reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>The orderly ſearcher.</hi> Order and method is great in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of <hi>all knowledge: method</hi> facilitates the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and ſtrengthens the <hi>memorie;</hi> it makes things more <hi>perſpicuous,</hi> and ſo more eaſie to be underſtood, and more ſtrongly and certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. That knowledge muſt needs be confuſed, which is gotten by <hi>amethodical</hi> ſtudie. <hi>Method</hi> demonſtrates the dependance of one thing upon another, and ſo makes all eaſie and facile. So that in <hi>ſearch of Scripture</hi> we ſhould not pick here and there a chapter, or verſe, but read in order; firſt the <hi>eaſieſt,</hi> and then the more <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult:</hi> for <hi>paſcimur apertis, exercemur obſcuris. Milk</hi> is eaſieſt for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> to exerciſe our ſence with. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe, that may <hi>build us up in the faith,</hi> as the Goſpels and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, then what may exerciſe our parts and learning. I take it a prepoſterous way of <hi>Scripture-ſearch,</hi> which many take, to ſearch firſt into the Propheſies, Revelations; and the darker places of Scripture, and neglect the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, and other ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier places. It is in <hi>Scripture-ſearch,</hi> as in all other <hi>ſciences,</hi> there are ſome more eaſie, and obvious <hi>principles,</hi> and theſe firſt to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we go to deductions and the like. Firſt, let us go where the <hi>lamb</hi> may wade, and then where the <hi>Elephant</hi> may ſwim.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>The judicious ſearcher,</hi> that reads with judgement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. As <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when he was reading the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Acts 8. 30. So ſay I to every ſearcher of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>understandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> No profit by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without underſtanding: therefore children and mad-men are no competent ſearchers of Scripture; there is required an act of <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>diſcretion.</hi> Or if, as the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> thou underſtandeſt not, then conſult with thoſe that do. Read ſtill in obedience to God's command, (nay, let this double thy endevaours) but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to conſult with the <hi>Philips,</hi> that is, the Miniſters of the word.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>The thankfull ſearcher,</hi> who, when he reads the Scriptures,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57001:168"/> meditates of and thankfully acknowledges the goodneſs of God, in giving and revealing to him the Scriptures. Chriſt himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed this thank-worthy, in Matth. 11. 25. <hi>I thank thee, O Father of heaven,</hi> &amp;c. and how much more ſhould we do it in regard of our ſelves? if we ſhall but conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What a great priviledge it is to a perſon or nation, to have the Scriptures, the word of God entruſted with them. This was the great priviledge of the Jews, which the Apoſtle takes notice of as their <hi>greateſt advantage above the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 3. 1, 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: He made them <hi>Truſtees</hi> of his word and promiſes. And the ſame would the Pſalmiſt have obſerved with thankfulneſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 How this is the onley light, which can lead us to heaven. This is the <hi>cloud,</hi> which will lead you through the wilderneſs unto <hi>Canaan:</hi> the light of nature is but <hi>a groping</hi> after God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. For though <hi>the inviſible things of God are clearly ſeen by the things that are made,</hi> as we have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. yet cannot the knowledge by nature at all diſcover Chriſt: without which knowledge no ſalvation, if you credit our Saviour himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. The Scripture is our onely ſtar to lead us unto Chriſt. The light of nature may lead men to hell and leave them there inexcuſable, but the light of Scripture can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light us to heaven: <hi>In them you think you have eternal life,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If you conſider ſeriouſly, How many thouſands in the world ſit in darkneſs, left to the natural blindneſs of their corrupt hearts: How many are in <hi>Egypt</hi> while we are in <hi>Goſhen, a land of light.</hi> Looke abroad into the world, and ſee, what palpable darkneſs is the greateſt part of it overclouded with and what fond guides do the moſt follow. The <hi>Mahumetan</hi> regulated and guided by a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous <hi>Alcoran:</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> enſlaved to fond and uncertain Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Jew</hi> being left to his own hardneſs, refuſing the Goſpel, following a few Curious <hi>Rabbines:</hi> and many thouſands, <hi>who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the ſound of the Goſpel,</hi> but are even <hi>without God in the world, having their underſtandings darkened,</hi> as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. while we enjoy the <hi>clear light</hi> of the glorious Goſpel, <hi>to guide our feet into the waies of peace.</hi> Obſerve we what God ſays to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, Deut. 4. 8. <hi>What nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgements ſorighteous,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe make a nation great: ſo may we ſay; and ſo oft as we read, or hear the word of God, ſhould thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge it.</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>The Practical ſearcher,</hi> who ſearcheth the Scripture: that he may thereby <hi>regulate his life,</hi> and <hi>order his converſation aright.</hi> It is one end why God hath given the Scriptures unto us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57001:169"/> 9. It is as a rule to walk by: Galat. 6. 16. <hi>As many as walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, peace be on them:</hi> ſuch ſhould all ſearchers of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be: for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Otherwiſe Scripture-ſearch will be in vain: it will be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe profitable to us to know Scripture, if we do not live by it, then to aggravate our ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. and <hi>to encreaſe our condemnation,</hi> that we ſhall have <hi>double stripes,</hi> Luk. 12. 47. It is better to be mere Ideots and Dunces in Scripture, then not to live according to them; better had we never ſearch for theſe heavenly treaſures, and ſpiritual pearls, then when we have found them to trample them under our feet. We ſhould ſearch Scripture for that end, for which God gave it: and that the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17, is <hi>that we might be throughly furniſhed unto every good work.</hi> He truely ſearches the Scripture, who reſolves, what ever command he meets with, though never ſo contrary to his luſt, that he will obey it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Prophet <hi>David meditate in the law of God,</hi> that he might make it <hi>a light unto his feet,</hi> Pſal. 119. 105.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No other ſearchers are like to finde the hidden treaſures of Scripture. God hath engaged to reveale himſelf to ſuch as theſe, <hi>Joh, 7. 16, 17. If any one will do his will he ſhall know,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> gives this as an account of his great knowledge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 98. Nothing improves knowledge more then a ſuitable practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the true reaſon, why men finde no more in the ſearching of Scripture, is, becauſe they read it more out of curioſity then of Conſcience. It is grace in the heart, and obedience in the life, that makes men fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Scripture-knowledge: Conſider that Emphatical place in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6. where the Apoſtle exhorts to a diligent acquiring, and practiſing of ſeveral graces, and gives the reaſon of it at ver. 8. <hi>For if theſe things be in you, you ſhall not be barren, nor unfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Turke</hi> writes upon his <hi>Alc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Every ungodly and wicked man is really prejudiced againſt Scripture-light, and knowledge. <hi>Joh. 3. 19. Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs.</hi> So many corruptions and luſts have all wicked men reigning in their hearts: ſo many real bolts and bars they have againſt the true Scripture-knowledge: it is irkeſome and troubleſome to them to entertain that truth which will diſcover their ſins, and ſo break and diſturb the ſecurity they have been in a long time: and therefore they rather with thoſe in <hi>Job</hi> deſire God <hi>to depart from them.</hi> As the Philoſopher obſerves <gap reason="foreign">

Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcripture will enflame our zeal in prayer, and prayer will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and facilitate our ſtudy of Scripture. <hi>Moſes</hi> when the Ark ſet forward, and when it reſted again, prayed devoutly, as we may read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 35, 36. ſo when you ſet upon reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when you reſt from it, do it with prayer.

Open thou mine eyes, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wondrous thing out of thy law.</hi> God infuſeth not knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by miracles immediately, as into the Apoſtles, but by the uſe of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57001:170"/> means: compare <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4, 6. The freeneſs of God in giving does not diſmiſs us from endeavouring: for though faith is ſaid to be <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. yet it is ſaid alſo <hi>faith comes by preaching,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. Prayer is the way to come by the ſpirit, which diſcovers the depths, and treaſures of the Scriptures: <hi>Luke 11. 13. Your heavenly father will give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him.</hi> This is the onely key to unlock thoſe rich cabinets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are contained thoſe precious jewels of ſaving truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>VIII. <hi>The believing ſearcher:</hi> and indeed without the eye of faith we are like to do little good in ſearching: the Goſpel is <hi>an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thing</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>to them that periſh, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 3. &amp; who thoſe are you may ſee at verſ. 4. thoſe <hi>who believe not.</hi> They, who come not with faith, may ſearch into the letter, and hiſtorie of Scripture, but not into the myſtery and ſpirit of Scripture. The Apoſtle tells us, the Jews had <hi>a veil upon their hearts,</hi> and <hi>their minds were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while Moſes was read,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 14, 15. viz. the veil of unbelief, that they could not ſee through thoſe ceremonies, or thoſe clearer propheſies, which in the old Teſtament were made of Chriſt. So there is ſtill a veil of unbelief upon every natural mans heart, <hi>which veil is done away in Christ,</hi> ver. 14. viz. by faith in him, then God reveales himſelf to ſuch. God, when he manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Moſes</hi> put him into a rock, Exod. 33. 22. and this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Chriſt: God diſcovers himſelf, and his minde to thoſe who are in Chriſt by <hi>faith. We have the minde of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. that is, <hi>we believers. Scriptura peculiaris eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum Dei ſchola,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> They are the onely good ſcholars, who read the Scriptures with <hi>faith.</hi> The Scriptures are <hi>able to make perfect the man of God,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 17. The man of God: Nihil hic faciet filius hujus ſeculi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus.</hi> A carnal heart will hardly be a proficient here.</p>
                  <p>IX. <hi>The Chriſtian ſearcher:</hi> He who ſearcheth Scripture that thereby he may come to know and enjoy Chriſt, and indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this all is in vain. The moſt curious, exact, learned ſearcher doth but ſearch them to his own deſtruction, if he doth not hereby come to a ſaving knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>They testifie of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and therefore (or to this end) that you may know me, whom they teſtifie of, <hi>Search.</hi> In <hi>ſearching</hi> the Scriptures, ſearch, that you may <hi>know</hi> me. And this brancheth it ſelf into two parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, No knowledge of Chriſt without the Scriptures. The things that are ſeen may lead us to the inviſible things of God:</hi> that is, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>God-head</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. but theſe lead us not to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:57001:170"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, The whole Scripture gives us a full teſtimony and diſcoverie of Chriſt:</hi> more <hi>darkly</hi> in the <hi>Old,</hi> more <hi>expreſſely</hi> in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> That teſtifies of Chriſt <hi>to come,</hi> this of Chriſt as <hi>alreadie come: this</hi> is but the fulfilling of <hi>that.</hi> Our Saviour here ſends theſe to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> in which they were exactly verſed, ſo as<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, they could tell you <hi>any word</hi> in it, as readily as their <hi>own name. All the Prophets ſpake of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 10. 43. Three ways the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeak of Chriſt, which I rather mention, becauſe it is the chief <hi>intereſt</hi> of the Text, as alſo to <hi>strengthen</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>true Meſsiah</hi> againſt the Jews: and hereby to admoniſh us in reading and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to look after Chriſt, and the knowledge of him.</p>
                  <p>I. By <hi>promiſes:</hi> as the <hi>promiſed ſeed</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ. 15. to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Geneſ. 26. to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Geneſ. 28. to the <hi>tribe of Judah,</hi> Geneſ. 49. and all theſe are great aſſurances to our faith.</p>
                  <p>II. By <hi>plain propheſies.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>Jacobs Shiloh,</hi> in <hi>Gen. 49. 10. Balaams ſtar coming out of Jacob,</hi> Numb. 24. 17. <hi>Iſaiahs Immanuel,</hi> Iſaiah 7. 14. <hi>Daniels man, ſtanding before the Ancient of daies,</hi> Dan. 7. 13. <hi>Jeremiahs the Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> Jerem. 23. 6. <hi>Zechari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs branch,</hi> Zech. 3. 8. and <hi>Malachies Sun,</hi> Mal. 4. 2. And this in general: it would be infinite to deſcend to particulars: not a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his <hi>birth, life,</hi> or <hi>death,</hi> but was foretold by ſome of the Prophets. The <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>birth,</hi> Micah. 5. 2. the manner of his <hi>conception,</hi> Iſai. 7. 14. his <hi>humilitie</hi> and <hi>povertie</hi> of life, Zech. 9. his <hi>death,</hi> Iſai. 53. 7. <hi>Judas's betraying</hi> and <hi>ſelling him for thirtie pieces of ſilver,</hi> Zech. 11. 12, 13. his <hi>ſcourging,</hi> Iſai. 53. 5. his <hi>being ſpit upon,</hi> Iſai. 50. 6. his <hi>crucifying among thieves,</hi> Iſai. 53. 12. and after death his <hi>reſurrection</hi> and <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> Pſal. 110. and Hoſea 13. 14.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>In types and ſhadows.</hi> The whole <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were nothing elſe but <hi>ſhadows:</hi> Chriſt the <hi>ſubstance.</hi> Thus was Chriſts <hi>paſsion</hi> typified by the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> by the <hi>Braſen ſerpent</hi> lifted upon a pole, <hi>John</hi> 3. 14. His <hi>taking away our ſins</hi> by his death typified by the <hi>ſcape goat,</hi> Levit. 16. 10, 21. His <hi>lying three days in the grave,</hi> and <hi>his reſurrection,</hi> typified in <hi>Jonah,</hi> chap. 1. <hi>The pillar of cloud,</hi> and <hi>of fire,</hi> the <hi>Red-ſea, Manna, Rock,</hi> all types of Chriſt; of which latter, the Apoſtle ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>that rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor 10. 4. I have mentioned theſe, to lay an engagement upon you in ſearch of Scripture, eſpecially to look after Chriſt: he is the <hi>ſcope,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>center</hi> of all Scripture. Doeſt thou read the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of the old Law? look upon them as <hi>ſhadows,</hi> of which Chriſt is the <hi>bodie</hi> and <hi>ſubstance.</hi> Doeſt thou read the Promiſes?
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57001:171"/> look upon them all, as <hi>Yea and Amen in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. Doeſt thou read the <hi>Sacraments?</hi> eye Chriſt as the thing <hi>ſealed</hi> by them. Doeſt thou ſearch the <hi>Law?</hi> Read it as thy <hi>ſchool-maſter</hi> to bring thee unto him, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 24. The <hi>Propheſies?</hi> Chriſt the fulfilling of them. Thus all the <hi>lines</hi> and <hi>draughts</hi> of Scripture meet in this <hi>centre:</hi> all Scripture <hi>light</hi> centres in <hi>this Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, ſearch Scripture never ſo much, you are ſtill in the <hi>dark,</hi> if it be not your <hi>ſtar</hi> to lead you unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much of the ſecond thing, <hi>What ſearchers of Scripture Chriſt here points at.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the third General,</p>

                  <p>I. <hi>The univerſalitie of the ſubject, All men;</hi> none being exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this dutie. <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> are eſpecially concerned in this, who are to diſpence the Myſteries of ſalvation unto others. It is an old and true ſaying, ſealed by the experience of all ages, that <hi>Bonus textuarius eſt bonus Theologus; A good Scripturiſt is a good Divine:</hi> and therefore does the Apoſtle give this eſpecially in charge to <hi>Timothy, Till I come, give attendance to reading,</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. But, not onely theſe, <hi>every Chriſtian</hi> is concerned in this duty, if upon no other conſiderations, then theſe in the Text; they are abundantly evincing. Every Chriſtian is concerned in <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life:</hi> Therefore, ought to ſtudie Scripture, which directs him the way thither; and it is therefore called <hi>the word of life,</hi> Philip. 2. 16. and, <hi>the Goſpel of our ſalvation,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. As a traveller, that is ignorant of his way, wili be oft conſulting his Maps, examining, and enquiring which is the way: we are all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ignorant of the true way to life, and therefore we muſt oft <hi>ſearch Scriptures,</hi> which are the Map of that <hi>Jeruſalem, which is above,</hi> directing us the way thither. So Chriſt is the <hi>onely way,</hi> out of of whom, no man can come thither, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. And then, the <hi>knowlege of Chriſt</hi> is every Chriſtians <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Hence are thoſe frequent exhortations of Scripture to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>To grow in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. And this we come to by Scripture; <hi>They teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in the Text. Beſides theſe, all are engaged to the ſearch of the Scriptures upon theſe accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In obedience to Divine command.</hi> God exempts none from this dutie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. but ſends all <hi>to the law and teſtimony,</hi> Iſai. 8. 20. and it is the Apoſtles frequent command, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 16. and his charge is very ſhort, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 27. and what are all the <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums</hi>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:57001:171"/> and <hi>commendations</hi> of thoſe who conſcienciouſly perform this duty, but ſo many <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> for us to do it? Such are that character of a <hi>godly man,</hi> Pſal. 1. 3. that <hi>he meditates in the law of God both day and night:</hi> that commendation of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> who <hi>ſearched the Scriptures,</hi> Acts 17. 11. and that of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to whom he wrote, telling them, that <hi>they did well in taking heed to that ſure word of propheſie,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. Therefore the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of this ſearching Scripture is a diſobedience to a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In conformitie to the practiſe of the Saints in all ages. Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> ordinary tent-makers, ſo well skilled in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that they were able to inſtruct an eloquent <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18. 24, 25, 26. It ſpoke Gods approbation of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> ſearching the Scriptures, when he ſent <hi>Philip</hi> to him, Acts 8. 28. <hi>Timothy</hi> was an apt ſcholar in this ſchool, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. inſtructed, queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, not by his father (who was a <hi>Greek</hi>) but by his grand-mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and his mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> whoſe faith the Apoſtle highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. whence it is obvious to collect the induſtrie of Godly women in thoſe times, in ſearching <hi>themſelves,</hi> and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>their children</hi> in the Scriptures: a good copie for others to write after. Amongſt the Jews it was accounted a crime to have a family without a Bible; I wiſh it were ſo now.</p>

The word of God is not only <hi>ſeed</hi> to <hi>beget</hi> Chriſtians, but <hi>milk</hi> to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>nouriſh</hi> them. The <hi>want of the word</hi> is compared to a <hi>famine, Amos</hi> 8. 11.

And again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. You ſee the faith of the Chriſtian Church is built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the doctrine &amp; writings, as well of the Prophets, as of the Apoſtles, both leading us to Chriſt, as to <hi>that onely foundation, Cor.</hi> 3. 11. viz. <hi>of ſalvation.</hi> Again, 2 <hi>Pet, 1. 19. To which</hi> (that is, <hi>that ſure word of propheſie) you do well that you take heed:</hi> even that which was written before, by the Prophets, is as a light to direct you. And therefore obſerve, how <hi>Abraham</hi> diſpatcheth the <hi>Gluttons</hi> brethren to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets,</hi> Luke 16. 29. whence it is obvious to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the writings of <hi>Moſes, &amp; the Prophets</hi> are to be read, heard, and aſſented to by Chriſtians under the Goſpel. To all which we may add that full place of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 5. 17. 19. <hi>I come not to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. If Chriſt did not diſſolve them then certainly Chriſtians muſt not neglect to ſearch them: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo far from diſſolving, that he did fulfill them, and that in his doctrine, which was ſuitable, and comformable to that of the Law and the Prophets; in his life by obedience, exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57001:173"/> the commands of <hi>the law,</hi> and in his ſufferings to what <hi>the law threatned,</hi> and <hi>the Prophets</hi> had foretold. The reaſons then, why <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> are to ſearch both, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Becauſe <hi>both are the voice of God to us.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us expreſly that the ſame God, who <hi>at divers times, and in divers ways ſpake to the fathers, hath in theſe last daies ſpoken alſo unto us,</hi> Heb. 1. 1. both are <hi>by divine inſpiration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>All Scripture is given:</hi> not <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that:</hi> and 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. The propheſies of old time,</hi> &amp;c. what they wrote, they were God's <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> and wrote not their <hi>private phantaſies,</hi> but the <hi>dictates</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Holy men they were of God, and therefore their authoritie unqueſtionable and immutable, their value and uſe great and excellent. To the <hi>moral law</hi> we are all obliged, as a rule of our obedience, and though not to the obſervance of the <hi>ceremonial,</hi> yet to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and meditation of it, as very uſefull, both to acquaint us with variety of God's diſpenſations, and by the comparing of thoſe ſhadows and types with Chriſt, the bodie and ſubſtance, they may be evidences of Chriſt already exhibited, and <hi>come in the fleſh.</hi> The conſulting all Scripture is both our intereſt, and duty, as having God the author of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>The harmony, and identitie of Scripture doctrine both in the Old, and New Testament.</hi> The ſame for ſubſtance, though different in degrees: the ſame object of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, to whom <hi>all the Prophets witneſſed, Acts.</hi> 10. 43. otherwiſe thoſe under that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation had been in a loſt, undone condition: for <hi>Acts. 4. 12. There is no other name given under heaven, whereby men may be ſaved.</hi> The Prophets repreſent Chriſt in his <hi>perſon,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> Iſai. 7. 14. In his <hi>offices,</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> Iſai. 42. 1, 2, 3. as a <hi>Prieſt</hi> Pſal. 110. 4. as a <hi>King,</hi> Pſal. 2. 6. and in all his benefits, as <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> That in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. is a moſt pregnant teſtimony in our <hi>justification by faith,</hi> verſe 11. And both old and new Teſtament preſcribe the ſame holineſs, obedience, and love to God, and our neighbour. They differ indeed in the clearneſs of Revelation, not in the ſubſtance of the doctrine. The Goſpel takes off the veil, and lets us ſee the myſteries of Salvation more clearly. Now the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is evident, that <hi>if the doctrine of ſalvation be the ſame in both, then both are to be ſearched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Becauſe <hi>all the Scriptures, both of old and new Teſtament, were written for the uſe, and good of Chriſtians.</hi> The commands of the Law for our practiſe, as our Saviour told that Lawyer, <hi>Luke 18. 26, 28. How readeſt thou in the law?</hi> The promiſes for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; as that promiſe which was peculiar to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> chap. 1. 5. is repeated to all Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. 5. The threatnings and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57001:174"/> for our example and terrour: as the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the judgements which fell upon the Iſraelites, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 11, 12. So the types: obſerve how our Saviour applies the type of the <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> to his <hi>own death,</hi> John 3. 14. and that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and <hi>ſupport of our faith,</hi> verſe 15. That, as he, who looked upon the <hi>braſen ſerpent,</hi> was healed of the ſtings of the <hi>fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;</hi> ſo they, that look up to Chriſt by a <hi>true faith,</hi> are healed of the <hi>ſpiritual wounds</hi> made by ſin and Satan.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Becauſe of <hi>the excellencie of all Scripture,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle fully deſcribes to us in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. What are uſefull as <hi>children</hi> to know; what may <hi>make us wiſe to ſalvation;</hi> what is <hi>profitable for doctrine</hi> to inform us; for <hi>reproof</hi> to reclaim us; for <hi>correction</hi> to reform; for <hi>inſtruction</hi> to guide us, and <hi>furniſh us unto every good work.</hi> This the Apoſtle affirms univerſally of all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not of this, or that part of it; therefore of the <hi>old,</hi> as well as <hi>new Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>To ſtrengthen and confirm the doctrine of the new Teſtament;</hi> to which both Chriſt and the Apoſtles oft ſend Chriſtians, and blame them for their ignorance in them, <hi>Luke 24. 25. Then he ſaid unto them, O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore it was the conſtant practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles to aſſert their authoritie, and confirm their doctrines by the <hi>old Teſtament;</hi> as in the Text here: and he grounds theſe Jews unbelief upon their not believing <hi>Moſes,</hi> verſe 46, 47, <hi>For had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me: But if ye believe not his writings, how ſhall ye believe my words?</hi> Where Chriſt confirms his doctrine by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who wrote of him. This was the Apologie <hi>S. Paul</hi> made for himſelf, and his doctrine, in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. So our Saviour proves the doctrine of the <hi>reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Matth. 22. 31. and the doctrine of his <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>reſurrection,</hi> Luke 24. 44, 45. And the truth is, much of <hi>Goſpel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> can neither be underſtood, nor proved without the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: as that of the Iſraelites in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. whence ſhould Chriſtians underſtand that, but out of the hiſtorie of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> of the <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>cloud,</hi> the <hi>ſea,</hi> and the <hi>rock;</hi> and eſpecially, the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> without an exact knowledge of the <hi>legal ſacrifices, priesthood</hi> and the like; and the lives of the <hi>Patriachs</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And laſtly, <hi>To convince the Jews of the truth of Chriſt our Meſsiah, and ſatisfie Chriſtians in their temptations concerning it:</hi> as the <hi>fulfilling of the Propheſies,</hi> the <hi>realizing of the Types</hi> concerning Chriſt. This <hi>Apollos</hi> found to be the moſt convincing way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 28. And there is no other poſſible way to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57001:174"/> effect this: for the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> they reject. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge, and cannot fathom the depths and myſteries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, nor judge of the <hi>true Meſsiah;</hi> nor can you convince them by the <hi>miracles of Chriſt,</hi> for they deny them, or elſe impute them to <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> If we would convince them then, we muſt build upon ſome <hi>Principles,</hi> which they grant, otherwiſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the whole: therefore the only way to convince them is, to ſhew the <hi>conformitie</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> of all Chriſts <hi>doings</hi> and <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> to what the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old foretold of the <hi>true Meſsiah.</hi> Which courſe our Saviour himſelf took to prove himſelf the <hi>true Meſsiah,</hi> Luke 24. 44. and therefore the ſearch of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is much conducible to the <hi>ſtrengthning of our faith in Chriſt</hi> againſt the Jews. For when we conſider the exact Propheſies of the time of <hi>Chriſts coming,</hi> Gen. 49. 10. and <hi>while the temple ſtood,</hi> Hag. 2. 7. <hi>the place of his birth,</hi> by <hi>Micah,</hi> chap. 5. verſe 2. <hi>born of a virgin,</hi> Iſai. 7. 14. <hi>the miracles to be wrought by him,</hi> Iſai. 35. 5, 6. <hi>his paſsion and ſufferings,</hi> Iſai. 53. theſe are ſufficient, when we finde them ſo punctually fulfilled in Chriſt, to <hi>strengthen our faith</hi> in him, and to convince the Jews of their deſperate unbelief: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe, who deny Chriſtians the uſe of the old Teſtament, rob them of their weapons, whereby they ſhould contend for the faith, and fight againſt the enemies of Chriſt, the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The grounds of this ſearch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe I ſhall reduce to theſe four heads.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>The Scripture-fulneſs and ſufficiencie:</hi> and this is clear in the words of the Text: <hi>In them you may have the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>eternal life:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where we may conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>a full and perfect foundation of faith, as containing all things neceſſarie to be believed,</hi> either <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>by convincing, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequence.</hi> So full and perfect it is, that it needeth not to be eeked out with <hi>unwritten traditions,</hi> or <hi>pretended enthuſiaſmes,</hi> and <hi>revelations.</hi> That <hi>tradition,</hi> which brings down, and conveys Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-truth to us through the <hi>ſucceſsive ages</hi> of the Church, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not caſt out, but acknowledge as an eminent inſtance, and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods Providence: and in this ſenſe the Church is called <gap reason="foreign">

So for <hi>revelation;</hi> we acknowledge <hi>a ſpiritual revelation to underſtand,</hi> which the Apoſtle prays for, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17. but any thing additional to Scripture-truth, we reject, as detracting from the wiſdome of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57001:175"/> God, and his <hi>revealed truth.</hi> Obſerve we what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal. 1. 18. If we or an angel from heaven preach any other doctrine.</hi> He does not ſay, <hi>Contra, againſt,</hi> but <hi>praeter, beſide,</hi> ſaies <hi>Paraeus.</hi> Here is enough to bring you to ſalvation; elſe <hi>S.

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> a pattern for making the Tabermacle, and <hi>David</hi> of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: God hath ſet us a <hi>perfect rule</hi> of <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> in his word, and nothing pleaſeth him, but what is <hi>according to that rule.</hi> When our Saviour told <hi>the woman of Samaria,</hi> John 4. 22. <hi>We know what we worſhip: We,</hi> that is, the Jews: the ground ſure was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Jews had a <hi>particular appointment</hi> of God for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> had not. Therefore nothing muſt be impoſed upon Chriſtians, as obligatory to conſcience (though ſomething for order, and decencie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.) as Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or as the immediate worſhip of God, or as duties eſſentially neceſſary in order to ſalvation. This is juſtly abhorred, as the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as an infringement of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie, and as a detracting from the perfection of the word of God. <hi>Non ex arbitrio Deo ſerviendum eſt, ſed ex imperio.</hi> What <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the Heathen worſhip, I ſhall ſay of all will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is beſides the word of God: <hi>Ex religione ſuperstitio compingitur, &amp; eò irreligioſior, quantò Ethnicus paratior.</hi> Men in this caſe are laboriouſly ſuperſtitious, and take a great deal of pains to be irreligious.

                  <p>Secondly, When you have ſearched it, <hi>walk according to this rule.</hi> Take the word of God to regulate your lives by; this is an evidence and note of a true, upright, ſincere Chriſtian, to take the word of God as his rule. So <hi>David</hi> deſcribes them, <hi>Pſal. 119. 1. Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord;</hi> that is a note, that they are undefiled, upright, and ſincere. This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced <hi>Jobs</hi> uprightneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 10, 11, 12. And yet how few

I hate vain thoughts, but thy law I love.</hi> And there is a <hi>new,</hi> lately unheard of, <hi>generation,</hi> now ſtart up, who neglecting the Scriptures pretend to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led and guided by a <hi>light within them.</hi> Let us (if you think it worth the while) examine this opinion, and I think it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed ſufficiently by <hi>Mat. 6. 23. If the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> Whence theſe things are obvious to be collected.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is poſsible the light within a man may be darkneſs:</hi> as the light, which the Heathens had within them, was, who had <hi>their underſtanding darkned,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. and as the light of every <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man</hi> is, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That if it be ſo, it is a miſerable darkneſs. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; How great is that darkneſs?</hi> that is, he that followeth ſuch a light is in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, deplorable condition; as he that followeth the light of ſome Meteor in the night, which leads him into ditches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This light within</hi> (as being every mans pretence, and in moſt men a falſe light, and in one contrary to another) <hi>muſt be tryed:</hi> and then preſently, it ſuppoſeth ſome certain rule, by which it muſt be tryed, (otherwiſe, we ſhall never be ſecured from deluſion and errour) and this rule can be no other, then the <hi>infallible word</hi> of God. All that light is darkneſs, which is not lighted at the Lamp of Scripture: ſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us expreſly, <hi>Iſai. 8. 20. If they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> Therefore as <hi>David,</hi> ſo all Chriſtians ſhould walk by that light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this opinion ſuppoſeth a light naturally ſet up in every mans ſoul, which by following its direction may bring them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then <hi>this is plain down right Pelagianiſme,</hi> and ſpeaks the grace of God needleſs, and tells God that he was at an unneceſſary expence of wiſdome and mercy, when he gave us Scripture, which the Apoſtle tells us is <hi>onely able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> in 2 Tim. 3. 15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>God hath no where commanded us to walk by any ſuch rule, as a light within.</hi> By the Prophet <hi>David</hi> he ſends us to <hi>his word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way, by taking heed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy word:</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> would have all walk by the <hi>ſame rule,</hi> Phil. 3. 16.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Suppoſe it a <hi>true law and light, an effect of regeneration,</hi> yet not a <hi>rule,</hi> becauſe <hi>imperfect:</hi> for ſtill the Prophet remits us to that law <hi>written in the volume of the book of God,</hi> Pſal. 40. 7, 8. and by
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57001:176"/> it, it does evidently appear, that there is no <hi>law</hi> or <hi>light</hi> within the heart, to be accounted of, but what is agreeable with, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the law <hi>written in the volume of the book.</hi> But however, be it what light it will be, which theſe pretend to walk by; I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to you, that thoſe are not in <hi>the light,</hi> but in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> from 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. And certainly into the number of thoſe, whom the Apoſtle there mentions, it is no uncharitableneſs to put theſe, whoſe conſtant practiſe is to ſpit hell and damnation in every mans face, though ſuch as walk holily and umblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Is not every man concerned to follow the light, and inward guidance of his own conſcience?</hi> I anſwer, No, unleſs his conſcience be rightly informed, and regulated by the word of God. For conſcience is but <hi>Regularegulata:</hi> and though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſobey a <hi>falſe light</hi> of conſcience without ſin, ſo nor follow it without ſin neither: ſo that the obligation, which an erroneous conſcience lays upon a man, is not to act contrary to it; but he ought to get that falſe light extinguiſhed, and his conſcience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed, and a true light ſet up from the word of God. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this therefore, and all other pretended lights or rules, contrary to, or beſides this: I ſhall cloſe this argument with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 6. 16. As many as walk according to this rule, Peace be on them, and the Iſrael of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument or ground for <hi>Scripture-ſearch</hi> is <hi>Scripture plaineneſs and perſpicuity.</hi> It is the deſire and plot of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to faſten an imputation of obſcurity upon the Scripture, that hereby ſhe may with the more plauſible pretence exalt <hi>Peters</hi> pretended ſucceſſour in the infallible chair, as an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring interpreter; and alſo diſcourage the people from reading them, as perſwading them, that the treaſure lies too deep for them to finde, and therefore it is to no purpoſe for them to ſearch: but this is to bring a falſe report upon the Scripture, as the ſpies did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>land of Canaan.</hi> All truths neceſſarie to ſalvation are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down in Scripture: whence the Scripture is ſo oft compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>a light;</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. Indeed, here we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>myſteriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>obſcurity</hi> of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and the manner of the revelation. Scripture-myſteries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are obſcure and deep, in which reſpect <hi>S. Peter</hi> obſerved <gap reason="foreign">

This is that, which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 119. 129. Thy teſtimonies are wonderfull; there is the myſtery: but in verſe</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:57001:177"/> 130. <hi>The entrance of thy word giveth light;</hi> there is the perſpicuity.

                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of this will be two-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Here we learn the unexcuſableneſs of mens ignorance of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> Thou can'ſt not pretend, that it doth not concern thee; for Chriſt hath bidden thee, <hi>ſearch it:</hi> nor yet make the obſcurity of it a plea, for all ſaving truths lies obvious and plain in it. There is indeed <hi>strong meat</hi> for <hi>grown Chriſtians;</hi> but here is <hi>milk</hi> too for <hi>Babes</hi> in knowledge: here are myſteries to exerciſe the acuteſt wits, depths for the profoundeſt judgements: but what may make thee <hi>wiſe to ſalvation</hi> is ſo plain, that a man of the meaneſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may apprehend it: therefore (eſpecially, amidſt ſo many means of knowing it, as publick reading, and preaching) the ignorance of it in any is inexcuſable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Pray to God for the Spirit to be your teacher in theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-myſteries:</hi> that you may all <hi>be taught of God,</hi> as it is in <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. Without this you will be in the dark, and grope at noon-day. The Sun is moſt perſpicuous, yet we cannot ſee it without its own light: the <hi>things of the Spirit</hi> revealed in Scripture are clear and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſelves, but will not be ſo to us, without the <hi>light of the Spirit.</hi> There is indeed an <hi>external</hi> perſpicuity of Scripture in the words; this may be made out to the worſt of men by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of natural abilities, and by accompliſhment of Arts; nay, the devils may have a clear underſtanding of this: but then there is an <hi>internal</hi> perſpicuity of Scripture, evidenced to the ſoul by the enlightning of the Spirit of God ſhining into the heart, ſo irradiating the minde with a Divine light, that it ſees through the veil of the letter, and diſcovers the myſtery of the word. This light conveys an experimental taſte, and a ſweet reliſh of the truths of the word of God. In a word, the Scripture is plain, though we want light to ſee it; the Sun may ſhine, though a blinde man cannot perceive it: but now the Spirit brings a ſuitable light into the ſoul, proportioned to theſe Scripture-truths; which were indited and can onely be evidenced by the Spirit, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and Prayer is the way to come by the Spirit, <hi>Luke 11. 13. How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the Spirit to them that ask him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third argument for <hi>Scripture-ſearch</hi> is <hi>Scriptures authority,</hi> which is divine and infallible. <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirms, that it is of <hi>divine inſpiration,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and it is ſaid to be <hi>a more ſure word of propheſie,</hi> by <hi>S. Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. And herein I ſhall demonſtrate this one thing,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That theſe Scriptures are the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That theſe <hi>Scriptures are the word of God,</hi> I ſhall not trouble you
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57001:178"/> with a multitude of arguments to evince it, but yet I could not wholly omit it; becauſe all, who do profeſs it, do not really and fully believe it (as I ſhall evidence to you anon) and the faith of many Chriſtians, through the ſtrength of Satans temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, may ſometimes doubt of it: that I may therefore convince ſome, and ſtrengthen others, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>The teſtimony of the Church is not the firſt or chief ground, nor is it a ſufficient argument of that faith, whereby we believe the Scriptures to be the word of God.</hi> Into this indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ultimately reſolve its faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> openly profeſſes that, <hi>He would believe the Bible no more then the Alcoran, if it were not for the teſtimony of the Church.</hi> It is true, the outward teſtimony of the Church may be a motive, or a means of our belief of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for ſo ſhe is called <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> to hold it forth, and declare it; as the pillar holds forth the Princes Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but adds no authoritie to it. It may inform us of the truth, but not perſwade us of the truth. The Church hath the charge of Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Oracles of God being committed to her,</hi> (as it is ſaid of the Jewiſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2.) as a <hi>Truſtee</hi> of Divine truth, to maintain, uphold, expound, and declare Scripture; but not the firſt ground of our belief of it. As the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> believed the report of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdome by others, but more when ſhe heard it her ſelf: or as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed, becauſe of the report of the woman, but more when they heard him, <hi>John</hi> 4. 30, 40. The Church may hand the Scriptures to us, and we may believe them by, but not for the teſtimony of it. Or, as a mother may ſhew the childe the ſun, and tell him, <hi>that is the ſun,</hi> but yet the ſun mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts its ſelf by its own light: ſo the Church may tell us, this is Scripture, but it is impoſſible, that the ultimate reſolution of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith of <hi>ſupernatural truths</hi> ſhould be made into any humane, and ſo conſequently fallible, and uncertain teſtimony, when as we are to judge of the <hi>true Church</hi> by the Scripture. Nor can this be a conviction to any, that the Scriptures are the word of God: for either it muſt be to believers; and to them it is unneceſſary, for they have already effectually entertained it upon other grounds, <hi>viz. The inward evidences of the word,</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony of the Spirit:</hi> and it cannot be to unbelievers, for they reject the <hi>Church</hi> as well as the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and therefore they muſt be convinced of the <hi>true Church,</hi> before they will admit its teſtimony: and of this there is no other poſſible means to convince them, then by the Scriptures, which muſt be firſt evidenced unto them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>

                  <p>II. <hi>There are in Scripture ſufficient evidences and convictions, even to ingenuous reaſon, that it is the word of God.</hi> And this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for though, after any teſtimony appears to be Divine, reaſon muſt not be ſuffered to diſpute and queſtion the thing ſo atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: yet I cannot ſee, why reaſon ſhould not be uſed, as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or means to evidence ſuch a Revelation to be divine; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (though I may be otherwiſe convinced my ſelf) it is impoſſible to convince an Heathen, or gainſayer, that <hi>this is the word of God.</hi> Our faith is not irrational, and though the things revealed be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove reaſon, yet that it is ſupernaturally revealed, muſt be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to reaſon; otherwiſe my belief is raſh, precipitate, and irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; nor can I <hi>give a reaſon of the hope that is in me,</hi> as the Apoſtle requires, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. Therefore (omitting thoſe which I conceive leſs evincing) I ſhall lay down theſe few conſiderations to evidence this.</p>
                  <p>1. Conſider <hi>the ſublimitie of, and myſteriouſneſs of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture;</hi> ſuch as the moſt prying reaſon could never ſearch into, nor the moſt improved, raiſed parts and abilities ever reach; ſuch as the Philoſophers never dreamt of: ſuch is <hi>the fall of man,</hi> and <hi>our corruption by it,</hi> of which if the Philoſophers had ſome ruder notions, yet <hi>the means of mans ſin and miſery,</hi> viz. by the <hi>wilfull tranſgreſsion</hi> of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> made between God and man, of not <hi>eating of the tree of knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. this they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of; and much leſs could reaſon fathom the depth of that Wiſdome and Mercy which Scripture diſcovers in <hi>mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> by Chriſt; this is a depth which the very Angels deſire, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 12. to look earneſtly into.</hi> That <hi>Apostatized, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, miſerable man ſhould again be brought to life by the death of the onely Son of God; and that in a way of ſuch unſpeakable wiſdome, and ſecurity to all the attributes of God, with ſuch a full reconcilement of juſtice and mercy,</hi> is a myſterie reaſon can ſcarce apprehend now it is revealed, much leſs diſcover, and finde out at firſt. So <hi>God's entring into Covenant with lapſed man; an Unity in Trinity; Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by the bloud of Chriſt; Regeneration by the Spirit</hi> (you know <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus's</hi> reaſon was <hi>non-pluſs'd</hi> here, with a <hi>Quomodo? How can this be,</hi> John 3.) <hi>Reſurrection of the body,</hi> being crumbled into duſt: <hi>A laſt judgement,</hi> before the tribunal of that Chriſt, who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied here: theſe are things which the <hi>eye of reaſon</hi> could never have diſcerned, and which the moſt acute profound Philoſophers knew nothing of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What</hi> Plato <hi>knew of God, it is very probable, he had from</hi> Moſes, <hi>of whom he was very ſtudious,</hi> if we will believe <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Auguſt. l. 7. c. 21. confeſs.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> confeſſeth, when he had diligently peruſed <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:57001:179"/> he found nothing of our <hi>miſerie by ſin,</hi> and <hi>recovery by Chriſt:</hi> nothing of <hi>the blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinances by the blood of Chriſt. Hoc illae literae non habent,</hi> ſaith he. He could finde none there crying out with <hi>S. Paul, Quid faciet miſer homo?</hi> &amp;c. What ſhall miſerable man do? Who ſhall deliver him? None crying out, <hi>Thanks be to God through Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>Haec mihi inviſcerabantur miris modis, cùm minimum Apoſtolorum tuorum legerem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lord, theſe truths were incorporated in me, when I read the leaſt of thy Apoſtles.</hi> And truely, one end of Gods giving us Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was to ſupply the defect of reaſon. This conſideration will yet be more valid, if you conſider whom God was pleaſed to make uſe of, as inſtruments, to convey theſe myſteries to us: not an eloquent <hi>Tully,</hi> profound <hi>Plato;</hi> but <hi>Amos</hi> an <hi>Heardſman, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a <hi>Shepheard, Paul</hi> a <hi>Tent-maker,</hi> and many of the Apoſtles poor <hi>fiſhermen;</hi> men no waies enabled by acquired parts. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed was <hi>learned in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians,</hi> Acts 7. 22. but there he could not learn the Law and Truths of God, where Idolatry was ſo much overſpread. So <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel;</hi> but there he did not learn the myſteries of the Goſpel, but during that time he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to blaſpheme the truth, and to perſecute the Profeſſours of the Goſpel, which himſelf afterwards preached. <hi>Matthew,</hi> a Publican, made a Pen-man of the Scripture. All which ſpeak as the admirable wiſdome and omnipotent power of Gods grace, in conquering their hearts to a cloſing with the Goſpel, ſo Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing theſe things unto them, and in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner furniſhing them, and acting them by his Spirit, to write the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The exactneſs of Scripture-holineſs:</hi> ſuch as you ſhall meet with in no humane writings; <hi>faith purifying the heart, working by love.</hi> What exact patterns and examples does Scripture hold forth of Purity and Holineſs? <hi>Enoch walking with God: Abraham the friend of God:</hi> and <hi>David a man after Gods own heart.</hi> What ſtrict laws does it preſcribe? whereas Humane laws tolerate ſome ſins, this diſcovers the <hi>wages</hi> of the leaſt <hi>ſin</hi> to be <hi>death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Religions are fitted with Fleſhly liberties, to gratifie mens corruptions (witneſs <hi>Mahomet's Alcoran</hi> indulging a libertie to the fleſh) this commands thoſe pieces of holineſs, which are moſt contrarie, and repugnant to our natural corruptions; ſuch as <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, taking up the croſs,</hi> &amp;c. It diſcovers Original ſin, and <hi>man</hi> by the guilt thereof <hi>liable to the challenge of God, the cenſure of the law,</hi> in the firſt moment of his being: and that the <hi>leaſt ſin</hi> (every <hi>idle word) muſt be accounted for,</hi> Matth. 12. 36. Had it been an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57001:179"/> invention, you ſhall have found the <hi>fleſh gratified;</hi> as all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in the world have ſome way or other to do it. <hi>Non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> of <hi>Plato) istae Paginae vultum pietatis hujus, lachrymas confeſsionis, ſacrificium tuum, ſpiritum contribulatum, cor contritum: nemo ibi cantat, Nonne Deo ſubdita erit anima mea?</hi> that is, <hi>All the Heathen Philoſophie hath not ſo much as a ſhew of this piety, the tears of a broken heart, and a contrite ſpirit, which is thy ſacrifice: no man here crys out with David, Let all that is within me praiſe his holy name,</hi> Pſal. 103. 1. The principles of moralitie might deck and graniſh the outward man, but Scripture holineſs onely repairs and renews the ſoul, commands the very thoughts, and curbs the very firſt irregular motions of the heart. In a word, this onely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the ſoul into <hi>the image of God from glorie to glorie by the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The excellency of Goſpel-promiſes;</hi> ſuch as Philoſophers never hinted: ſuch as the apprehenſions of man cannot comprehend now they are revealed, much leſs could they imagine, or invent. It would be infinite to enlarge; I ſhall therefore inſtance but in two: <hi>Eaſe to troubled, wearied ſouls: Nemo ibi audit, Venite ad me, qui laboratis,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> ſpeaking of the writings of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. He could not among all the Platonick Philoſophers finde ſuch an expreſſion; ſo comfortable a promiſe, as this, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> No <hi>ſanctuary</hi> for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſouls, but <hi>the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> which this Scripture onely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Iſai. 40. 1, 2. Speak ye comfortably to Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Promiſe in <hi>Iſai. 43. 2. I will be with thee when thou paſſeſt through the fire, and through the water:</hi> not ſuch a Promiſe in all the writings of men: a Promiſe of Gods gracious preſence here, and then the Promiſe of eternal reſt in another world. The Heathens might dream of an <hi>Elyſium; Mahomet</hi> promiſe a confluence of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual <hi>carnal delights</hi> in green meadows to his followers; but an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made up of an <hi>eternal enjoying</hi> God by <hi>viſion</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> is a thing their reaſon could never reach, but muſt certainly be a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> as being that which <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, nor can enter into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>The nature and event of Scripture propheſies:</hi> which are ſuch as the <hi>eye of omniſcience</hi> onely can reach, as being beyond the foreſight of the moſt perfect creature. <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the ſerpents head,</hi> much above three thouſand years, er'e it was accompliſhed. So <hi>Jacobs</hi> propheſie of <hi>the coming of Shiloh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the departure of the Scepter from Judah,</hi> Gen. 49. fell out accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, a little before Chriſts birth, when the Jews were ſubjected
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57001:180"/> to the power of the Romans. Thus all the Prophets foretelling <hi>the calling of the Gentiles,</hi> a thing ſo ſtrange, that when accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many did not <hi>understand</hi> it, and more were <hi>offended at it. Iſaiah</hi> propheſied the captivitie, and deſtruction of Jeruſalem, even then, when the kingdome was in a flouriſhing condition, both which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward fell out. Thus <hi>Joſiah's</hi> name and actions were foretold three hundred years before his birth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 2. and <hi>Cyrus's</hi> an hundred years before his birth, <hi>Iſai. 45. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi> And what doth all this ſpeak but a Divine revelation. Man may ſee ſome things future, as they are in their cauſes, but to foretel ſuch future events, as are merely dependant upon the Divine will, ſuch as theſe are, is onely proper to God. <hi>Teſtimonium divinitatis, veritas divinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> ſaies <hi>Tertullian, The certainty of foretelling is a ſure Testimony of Divinity.</hi> And ſo we finde that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41. 22, 23. the foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch futurities is made a diſtinction of the true God, from all falſe ones.</p>
                  <p>5. Conſider <hi>how theſe Scriptures have gained authority and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the world by quite contrary means to other writings:</hi> not by ſinfull compliances with the humours, and luſts of men (which hath much promoted the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi>) for theſe it imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ſeverely taxes, and condemns: not inſinuated into mens mindes by the pomp and pleaſantneſs of Rhetorick: (no adornings with the flowers of Rhetorick, to make them ſeem gratefull to the world) but by a plain ſtile, and homely expreſſion. It gains accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by the <hi>myſteriouſneſs</hi> of the things more, then <hi>eloquence of the ſtile:</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4. My ſpeech and my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not with enticing words of mans wiſdome, but in demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, and of power.</hi> It is the cuſtome of men to ſlatter Great ones by a complemental dedication, and thereby to gain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and repute to their writings: but obſerve the dedications of the Scriptures, they are <hi>to the poor, condemned, ſcattered Saints at Corinth,</hi> and elſewhere; ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. Humane writings gain accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by the command and Patronage of Great ones: as <hi>Mahomet's</hi> upheld by a continued war; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> makes a <hi>fiery furnace</hi> for them who will not <hi>bow down</hi> to the <hi>Image</hi> he ſets up: but here it was quite contrary, a <hi>furnace, fiery tryals,</hi> and <hi>perſecutions</hi> prepared for them, who did receive, and profeſs the word, under many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours, yet it thrived, and the profeſſours thereof multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, not withſtanding all oppoſition, and diſadvantages. Which certainly, even in the conviction of reaſon, ſpeaks <hi>the hand of God</hi> ſtretched out to preſerve his word, and bringing in many to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of it: that notwithſtanding the oppoſition theſe Scriptures have met with from perſecuting Emperours, cunning
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57001:180"/> Hereticks, and at firſt promulged onely by a few poor fiſhermen, ſent out with that commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. to preach a <hi>crucified Saviour</hi> to an <hi>obſtinate world:</hi> that notwithſtanding all this, I ſay, it ſhould be preſerved, and propagated, ſpeaks it from God, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel</hi> a Phariſee argued, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 38, 39. Had it not been thus from God, ſurely God would long ſince have ſtopped the mouths of us, Miniſters of it, as the greateſt deluders and impoſtours in the world (whom yet he hath oft <hi>miraculouſly preſerved</hi> and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged) and have countenanced the oppoſers of it; whom yet his <hi>ſevereſt judgements</hi> have overtaken: witneſs <hi>Antiochus, Julian,</hi> and the reſt. That the Profeſſours of the Goſpel ſhould be as <hi>lambs</hi> among <hi>wolves,</hi> yet not devoured; that <hi>perſecution</hi> ſhould be <hi>ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebra magis ſectae,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaies: and that it ſhould thrive by<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertull. Apol.</hi> cap. 49.</note> oppoſition, this ſpeaks it ſurely to be from God.</p>
                  <p>6. Conſider <hi>the confirmation of this word by miracles, ſuch as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power could never reach.</hi> The Apoſtle indeed foretels <hi>the coming of Antichriſt</hi> to be with many <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> 2 Theſſal. 2. 9. yea, but <hi>lying wonders;</hi> but Scripture-miracles are ſuch, as can be effected onely by <hi>the arm of omnipotency:</hi> as, <hi>Dividing the ſea, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one born blinde, Feeding thouſands with a few loaves and fiſhes, Raiſing the dead from a ſetled corruption,</hi> as <hi>Lazarus:</hi> theſe are ſuch as <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I think, never pretended to: therefore, as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, when they could not do the <hi>like miracles,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, cryed out, <hi>This is the finger of God,</hi> Exod. 8. 19. ſo we here, <hi>This is the truth, the word of God.</hi> God would never certainly <hi>lay out</hi> his <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>work miracles</hi> to confirm, or ſeal to <hi>alye.</hi> At <hi>John</hi> 5. 36. our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour urgeth this as an argument, why his <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> ſhould be entertained.</p>
                  <p>7. Conſider <hi>Satans enmity againſt the Scripture.</hi> His great deſign is, (if poſſible to keep men from the <hi>letter</hi> of the Scripture) to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men from an effectual entertainment of the Goſpel: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ſtirred up, in all ages almoſt, Perſecutours to oppoſe it, and Hereticks to delude and wreſt it. It ſtrikes at, and threatens ruine to <hi>his kingdome,</hi> therefore he endeavours his utmoſt to ſubvert it: and therefore all the deſigns now on foot againſt the Scripture, you muſt look upon them, as the plots of Satan. You may read a piece of Philoſophy, Hiſtory, or any Humane writing, and finde little, or no reluctancie againſt the entertainment of it. Now, why ſhould not men bring as ready a belief to Scripture, or entertain the truth of it, when they read it? ſurely it is from the Devil, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to unbelief: even becauſe the <hi>God of this world hath blinded their eyes,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. Tertullian</hi> gathered the goodneſs of the Goſpel from this, <hi>Quòd à Nerone damnatum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57001:181"/> it was ſo perſecuted by <hi>Nero:</hi> and we the excellencie of the Scriptures from this, becauſe the Devil ſo much malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it.</p>
                  <p>8. Conſider <hi>how it advances God, and debaſes man.</hi> It gives God the glory of all his Attributes and Works: both in the work of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Redemption.</hi> It gives him the glorie of what we <hi>have</hi> and <hi>do: What haſt thou, that thou hast not received? I Cor.</hi> 4. 7. there in what we <hi>have,</hi> and in what we <hi>do, S. Paul</hi> acknowledges I <hi>Cor. 15. 10. I laboured more abundantly, yet not I, but the grace of God within me.</hi> It tells us, that <hi>of our ſelves we are not able to think a good thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. yet that <hi>we are able to do all things through Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. Now in Humane writings men ſeek their own applauſe and credit, and this moves them to write; but theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the <hi>glory; of God,</hi> which our Saviour more then once makes the <hi>badge</hi> of the truth of his doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 7. 19. and <hi>John</hi> 8. 50. &amp;c. Scripture advances God, as the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> and <hi>laſt end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus having finiſhed the Doctrine, I proceed to the</p>
                  <p>Fifth General,</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The <hi>Application</hi> of it.</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uſe Firſt, <hi>See here the cruel Antichriſtian tyranny of the Church of Rome,</hi> which forbids private Chriſtians the uſe and ſearch of the Scriptures: Antichriſtian ſurely in this; Chriſt bids, <hi>Search them, for in them ye think ye have eternal life:</hi> they forbid the ſearch of them, for fear of Hereſie and Errour. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The Scripture is profitable,</hi> they ſay, <hi>it is pernicious:</hi> our Saviour would have <hi>the light be ſet upon a càndleſtick,</hi> Matth. 5. 15. they <hi>put it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a buſhel,</hi> and ſo leave the people <hi>in darkneſs.</hi> How much againſt nature is it, to with-hold <hi>milk</hi> from a <hi>childe?</hi> ſo much it is to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>ſincere milk</hi> of Gods word from his children: or to ſend a ſouldier into the field unarmed, how cruel is it? So to rob the people of this <hi>ſpiritual armour,</hi> this <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> and expoſe them naked to the power and fury, the deluſions and ſtratagems of Satan. As the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> out of envy dealt with the <hi>wells of water,</hi> Gen. 26. 15. ſo do theſe with the Scriptures, they envy the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>water of life,</hi> therefore <hi>ſtop up</hi> theſe <hi>wells of ſalvation,</hi> or elſe throw dirt into them; ſo that the people can have little of the <hi>pure water,</hi> but as it is pudled with the dirt of their traditions, or Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Jeſuitical gloſſes and depravations: and being thus robbed of the <hi>compaſs of the Scripture,</hi> they quickly ſplit upon the <hi>rock of errour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uſe Second, <hi>Hence we learn that they are inexcuſable, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this duty:</hi> whom neither the command of God, their own good and advantage, neither Religion or Policie can prevail with:
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57001:181"/> but a few obſcene Poets, or idle Romances, or ridiculous Ballads are more ſearched by them, then the Scriptures. <hi>Get you Bibles</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtom) which are the phyſick and medicines of your ſouls.</hi> Surely, the neglect of this is intolerable. God hath not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened you with Scripture. There are many things that Jeſus did, which are not written, but <hi>theſe are written,</hi> John 20. 30, 31. that is <hi>theſe few.</hi> It is neither ſo coſtly nor dear, but the meaneſt may purchaſe it; nor ſo voluminous, but the moſt employed may read and ſearch it. The motives to it (as you heard before) are weighty, and therefore the neglect of it the more dangerous. But, becauſe many things may be pretended for the neglect hereof, I ſhall remove a ſcruple or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>Object.</hi> Say ſome, <hi>I am unlearned, I cannot ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer; I wiſh thou wert learned, and able to read they ſelf: but then know, thou oughteſt ſo much the more carefully to attend, and conſcienciouſly wait upon the publick read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture in theſe publick aſſemblies. This hath been the <hi>conſtant practiſe</hi> of the Church in all ages, as is evident partly in <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 16, 17. and partly in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. where you ſee in both places, it was the <hi>uſual cuſtome</hi> to have the Scriptures read in their <hi>publick aſſemblies;</hi> and after reading followed preaching. The ground whereof was, ſurely, as to preſerve <hi>the purity of Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrine</hi> in the Church, that the people, hearing the word ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read, might not be impoſed upon by <hi>errour,</hi> or <hi>deluſions</hi> of men: ſo alſo for the <hi>profit, advantage,</hi> and <hi>edification</hi> of thoſe, who cannot <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>ſearch</hi> the Scriptures; and that <hi>the preaching of the word</hi> might come with more light and power upon their hearts. If you cannot read <hi>your ſelves,</hi> get others to read <hi>unto you,</hi> and be you ſo much the more in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>meditation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Second <hi>Object. I have ſo much employment in the world that I have no leiſure to ſearch the Scriptures. If I ſhould privately ſearch Scripture, and attend frequently upon the preaching of the word, it would ſet me behinde hand in the world, and hinder my thriving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, This is much what the Apologie, that thoſe made, who pretended their <hi>farms,</hi> and <hi>oxen,</hi> as an excuſe for not coming unto the <hi>wedding,</hi> Matth. 22. But, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> break through your <hi>worldly employments,</hi> prefer <hi>God</hi> before the <hi>world,</hi> and your <hi>ſouls</hi> before your <hi>bodies,</hi> an <hi>act of Religion</hi> before all <hi>worldly buſineſs,</hi> and believe it, you will be no <hi>loſers</hi> by it; God will <hi>ſucceed,</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> your <hi>labours</hi> more. <hi>Never was any man a loſer by his Religion.</hi> See what God promiſed to the lews, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 24. that <hi>He would ſecure their land for them,</hi> while they <hi>went up</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>worſhip</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:57001:182"/> the Lord. And what our Saviour ſaid to the Diſciples, <hi>Luke 22. 35. When I ſent you out without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye anything?</hi> Thou pretendeſt no <hi>leiſure;</hi> the truth is, <hi>Non parùm temporis habemus, ſed multùm perdimus,</hi> ſaies <hi>Seneca,</hi> Yes, <hi>we have time enough, but we looſe too much of it.</hi> Thou haſt no <hi>leiſure</hi> for <hi>this:</hi> but, <hi>Art thou at leiſure for thy pleaſures,</hi> and not for <hi>Religion?</hi> for the <hi>world,</hi> and not for <hi>God?</hi> for ſhame cheat not your own ſouls with ſuch vain pretences, but as thou deſireſt the knowledge of Chriſt here, and the enjoyment of Chriſt hereafter, be conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this duty of <hi>Searching the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uſe Third, <hi>It reproves thoſe, who believe not this truth, that the Scripture is the word of God.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>This concerns not us, Go charge the Turks and Indians with this.</hi> No, (my Brethren) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our ſelves here are guilty of this, for though mens mouths profeſs it, yet their hearts deny it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>In words they profeſs God, but in works they deny him,</hi> Tit. 1. 16. Did men really believe the corruptions of their natures, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant liableneſs unto wrath; would there be ſo much pride, ſo much confidence in ſin? Did men really believe, that <hi>of every idle word they muſt give an account;</hi> would there be ſo much <hi>idle, frothy, ungodly, profane, laſcivious</hi> talking and diſcourſe? Did men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. that all thoſe vices there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed were <hi>the works of the fleſh;</hi> would thoſe ſins ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? Did men believe that <hi>they who did no wrong to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhould enter into, and dwell in the Tabernacle of God,</hi> Pſal. 15. 1, 5. would there be ſo much oppreſſion and extortion? Did men believe that <hi>God will come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon all them, that know not God, and obey not his Goſpel,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. would there be ſuch a contented wilfull ignorance of God? <hi>Truth,</hi> where it is effectually entertained, will have an influence upon the life. How do moſt men hold <hi>Goſpel-truth</hi> in <hi>unrighteouſneſs?</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaies, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did <hi>the light of nature,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. ſo theſe with-hold <hi>Goſpel-truths:</hi> for, certainly, <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in the life ſpeaks an <hi>ineffectual entertainment</hi> of the <hi>truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uſe Fourth, <hi>It condemns thoſe who do not value and prize the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> How did the Heathens prize their Oracles? yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of Chriſtians do not prize <hi>theſe Oracles of God,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. Three things there are, that make this out unto us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Mens wilfull and contented ignorance of Scripture.</hi> What things we prize, we ſearch into. How does the Scholar pry, and ſearch into thoſe notions, he affects and values? So would men do, if they did value and prize the word aright; but the contrarie to this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57001:182"/> is evident by their language, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways,</hi> Job 21. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Mens wearineſs in ſearching the Scripture.</hi> What things we prize, in the ſearch of them we finde delight: but, how are men tyred at a Sermon, or Sabbath, in which the Scriptures are read? Is not the language of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. the language of too many among us? <hi>When will the Sabbath be ended?</hi> &amp;c. Men are ſooner weary of <hi>this,</hi> then any <hi>other</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Mens ſeldom diſcourſing of Scripture.</hi> As they ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Matth. 26. 73. Thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee:</hi> ſo mens ſpeeches bewray their want of affections to the Scriptures. The Scholar upon every occaſion is diſcourſing of thoſe notions, which he prizeth: but men are far more wiſe to diſcourſe of the world, then of heaven, and heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>Uſe Fifth, <hi>Of exhortation: That you would endeavour to get your faith well grounded in this fundamental truth:</hi> that neither Satan tempt you, nor men diſpute you out of it; for till then</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Your faith will be uncertain and weak;</hi> as a building without a foundation; as a ſhip without ballaſt or anchor, ſoon toſſed and ſhip-wrackt: and this we may think is the cauſe of moſt mens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie in theſe declining times.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Your lives will be but looſe.</hi> If you be not throughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of your dutie of walking by Scripture-rule, you will walk at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and ſo amiſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Your comforts weak, if not grounded on Scripture-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> This is one main reaſon, why mens comforts ebb and flow ſo much; they are not grounded on a ſure belief of Scripture; and if once your faith in this truth waver, the foundation of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort muſt needs be ſhaken. For the attaining whereof I can give you no better direction, then that you <hi>Pray earnestly for the Spirit,</hi> that he would pleaſe</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>To open the eyes of your minde,</hi> illightning, and irradiating the <hi>underſtanding</hi> to ſee thoſe arguments, and evidences of this truth, which lie in the Scriptures. So <hi>S. John</hi> tells us, I <hi>John 2. 26. Theſe things have I written unto you, that no man ſeduce you.</hi> And, without this, all other arguments will be ineffectual to the begetting of a <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>through belief</hi> of this truth. As <hi>Agar,</hi> when her eyes were opened, ſaw <hi>a well of water,</hi> Gen. 21. 19. ſo there are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to evince this truth ſufficient in the Scriptures, but they will never be brought home to the ſoul with a <hi>full conviction,</hi> till the Spirit open our eyes to ſee them: for this is <hi>one end,</hi> why the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is <hi>given to us</hi> and <hi>received of us,</hi> that <hi>we may know the things that are freely given unto us by the Spirit of God,</hi> as in I <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:57001:183"/>2. <hi>To remove that natural enmitie and prejudice, that we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an effectual aſſent to the Goſpel, and ſo ſanctifie our hearts, as to make it cloſe with, and heartily embrace it, as the truth and word of God. Truth</hi> reſiſts our <hi>corruptions,</hi> and <hi>they it.</hi> What is the great <hi>Goſpel truth,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt his coming to undertake as our Jeſus?</hi> this we cannot ſavingly aſſent unto, but <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> as in I <hi>Cor 12. 3. No man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit.</hi> Corruption fills the ſoul with prejudices againſt the truth. The Philoſopher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> (though <hi>abſtruſe</hi> in themſelves) are ſooner learnt by a young man <hi>diſſolute,</hi> and that hath not tamed his <hi>paſsions,</hi> then <hi>morality:</hi> becauſe thoſe, being mere <hi>ſpeculations,</hi> bring no <hi>oppoſitions</hi> to his luſts, which the <hi>precepts</hi> of <hi>morality</hi> curb and reſtrain. So mens corruptions and unſubdued luſts prejudice the ſoul againſt the belief of Goſpel-truth, which the ſanctifying work of the Spirit doth ſubdue and remove, and ſo diſpoſes the ſoul for the entertainment of the truth of the Goſpel: as we ſee in <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who, having his <hi>luſts ſubdued</hi> once, came to <hi>preach that</hi> Goſpel, <hi>which</hi> before he had <hi>perſecuted.</hi>
